          The aging population undergoes changes, especially to the visual and nervous system that can impact the functioning in day-to-day living, which can affect overall health and well-being. “Older people tend to show reduced visual field size, increased absolute threshold luminance, reduced visual activity, reduced contrast sensitivity, increased sensitivity to glare, and poorer color discrimination.” (Boyce 438). An inevitable change includes the thickening of the crystalline lens, which causes an increase in absorption of light before it gets to the retina (and ultimately into the brain). Scattering of light within these layers increases sensitivity to glare. This also causes less color discrimination in shorter wavelengths causing older adults to perceive the world to have more of a yellow tint than what younger adults perceive. As the eye ages, it also loses ability to suppress transmission of rod signals to the brain. Rod photoreceptors in the eye are responsible for night vision because they are activated in dim lighting conditions (< 0.001 lux)[6]. With that being the case, the aging eye lessens its capacity to stop the transmission of those signals to the brain, contributing to the increased sensitivity to light. When creating a senior care lighting system, lighting should be designed to positively impact the aging visual, circadian and perceptual systems. The overall goal in designing for older adults is to create an environment with high enough ambient and task lighting, while avoiding direct glare in the eyes from luminaires.
        </p>
        <p>
          For older adults in long-term care facilities, the designer should consider using the 24-hour lighting scheme in common areas where residents are more likely to spend their waking hours. This may vary with the application. For example, in a single-room assisted living setting, the dual lighting scheme needs to be implemented in the room and in a common area, such as the dining room. In nursing homes, the dual lighting scheme can be implemented in day rooms and dining rooms. If power density requirements are still an issue, however, local supplementary lights from blue LEDs can be integrated into the design. Compliance to light treatment via supplementary lighting system may be an issue. In cases where compliance is not an issue, such as when the treatment is applied to healthy older adults living at home, ambient light levels can be reduced to 80-100 lux at the cornea (which is about 200-300 lux on the horizontal surfaces) of a neutral light source (3000-4100 K lamp) and the use of supplemental task light delivering 30 lux at the cornea of a blue light (λmax = 470 nm) from LEDs can be used for at least 2 hours in the morning.

      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>
          On average, older adults are not being exposed to a robust light/dark pattern in their daily lives to accommodate the needs of the aging eye. Since light/dark patterns are not robust, rest/activity patterns will not be either. Especially when older adults spend the majority of the day inside, circadian entrainment is non-existent and naps during the day and the inability to sleep through the night is common. As well, the aging population has been shown to have a decrease in melatonin concentration, which also contributes to the body’s disorientation when it comes to proper sleep time . Enforcing a robust light/dark schedule, and assurance that enough light will reach the back of the eye is the challenge. Targeting a higher CS of 0.4 during the day, assuming losses from absorbed or scattered light through the lens, and will better account for getting enough light through to reach a CS of at least 0.3. However, with higher light levels comes higher chance for glare perception, especially in older adults with higher sensitivity to discomfort from glare. When designing lighting for older adults, it is imperative to provide a lighting system with optics that allow for proper light levels to reach the eye while avoiding harsh glare caused by (especially if horizontal illuminance levels get too high). To reduce high discomfort from glare, choose lighting fixtures with a distribution that gives a vertical to horizontal illuminance ratio closer to 1 (illuminance that reaches the eye is a similar value to illuminance on the work plane).

        <p>
          The light levels recommended for the circadian system should be sufficient for older adults to perform daily visual tasks. In spaces where high circadian stimulation cannot be used, ambient light levels for the aging visual system should be 200-300 lux on the horizontal surfaces (80-100 lux at the cornea) of a neutral light source (i.e., 3000-4100 K lamp). More localized light will be needed to perform tasks that require seeing fine details (e.g., reading prescription bottle labels, chopping vegetables). Architects and specifiers should still provide lighting that gives high, glare-free illumination on the task with no direct or reflected view of the light source, soft shadows throughout the space, balanced illuminance levels, and light sources that provide good color rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some other lighting principles for the aging visual system that can help architects, specifiers, builders, facility managers, and homeowners light interior spaces include:
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">More light on task areas</h6>

        <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/3.jpg" class="float-right w-40 m-4 rounded" alt="" /></figure>
        <p>
          Use concentrated light to increase illuminance levels on the task. As much as 10 times more light will be required to see fine details (e.g., reading text with a small font size) or low-contrast objects (e.g., black thread on blue cloth) than is required to see most architectural structures (e.g., doors, cabinets, furniture). Increase light level in areas where visual tasks are performed by placing adjustable light fixtures close to the task, or by selecting lamps with more lumens (look for lumen rating on the package, not wattage; be careful not to exceed the lamp fixture wattage). Increase ambient light levels by keeping surface finishes light in color. Light-colored walls, floors, and ceilings will help minimize shadows and increase overall light levels in the living environment. Place light fixtures where visibility is important, such as below the kitchen countertop, over the kitchen sink, in the shower, and in closet and laundry spaces.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Less glare</h6>

        <p>
          Although older adults require more light to see, care should be taken to avoid glare. Glare is experienced when light sources or bright reflections in the field of view impair vision, or are uncomfortable. Very bright lights should not be placed against dark ceilings. The light source itself should be hidden with a shade, baffles, non-shiny louvers, or a shielding board. If a bare lamp is unavoidable (e.g., fan lights), it should be frosted to diffuse the light. In this same vein, clear glass light fixtures should also be avoided. The use of shiny floor finishes and polished surfaces should also be minimized to reduce reflection from light sources.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Balanced light levels</h6>

        <p>
          Due to optical and perhaps neural changes in the eye, older adults cannot adapt to dim lighting conditions as well as younger people. As a result, illuminance levels in transitional spaces, such as hallways and entrance foyers, should be similar to those of the adjacent spaces. The ambient light levels in adjacent spaces should be balanced to be approximately the same. Multiple switches or dimmers to create intermediate light levels in transitional spaces that lead from bright, outdoor areas, to dim, indoor spaces should be chosen. Transitional spaces should be dimmer at night and brighter during the day.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Enhanced colors</h6>

        <p>
          Color discrimination is poorer for older adults because of scattered light in the eye. The aged lens also absorbs relatively more short wavelength (blue) light, so it is particularly difficult to discriminate between, for example, dark purple and maroon. Use lamps with high lumens and good color rendering properties (CRI > 80).
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Improved contrast</h6>

        <p>
          Because contrast sensitivity is reduced with age, the visibility of important objects, such as stair edges, curbs, ramps, or doorways, can be greatly improved by increasing their contrast with paint or similar techniques. Contrasting colors to mark edges, such as doorframes, baseboards, or steps should be used.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Muted patterns</h6>

        <p>
          Avoid busy patterns on walls, floors, and furniture. Busy patterns can cause visual confusion and disorientation, especially to residents with eye diseases and/or Alzheimer’s.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Home-like feel</h6>

        <p>
          To make residents feel more at home with a warm atmosphere, while achieving higher light levels for circadian entrainment and stimulation, warmer furniture, flooring, and walls can be strategically used. Using warmer tones of wood or carpet flooring as well as a beige walls could make a space feel warmer even when using cooler CCTs, compared to using stark white walls and floors. The presence of a fireplace can also provide a more welcoming atmosphere.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Outside accessibility</h6>

        <p>
          Accessibility and encouragement to visit outdoor patios will provide fresh air and light stimulus from daylight.

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Alzheimer’s disease</h6>

        <p>
          Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes a slow deterioration of the neurons in the brain which results in memory loss, lessened cognitive functioning, and eventual decline in the ability to do daily tasks. Basically, the neurons communicating in the brain that are responsible for making connections for memory, thinking, or task-doing do not send strong enough signals for the actions to be completed. Contrary to misconceived notions, memories are not entirely lost, initially, they are just unable to be retrieved due to a poor connection. However, the brain is a muscle similar to the others in the body; if it is not strengthened, it will become weaker and weaker until it reaches its terminus. Strengthening of brain activity can be enhanced with stimulation from light through the eye. If stimulus is provided, potential enhancement of memory and activity have been shown to occur. Studies have shown the successful effect of using high light levels through the eye to stimulate the firing of neurons in individuals in the early onset of AD.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the aging eye being one factor for less light reaching the back of the eye, as a person ages, it is more likely for them to stay inside and not being exposed to a robust light/dark schedule. This, consequently, leads to circadian disruption and poor sleep quality. This disruption can cause constant tiredness and can have an effect on mood and behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along with these, consistent circadian disruption can lead to the onset of complications associated with AD. Whether a preventative measure, or delaying the onset of diagnosed AD, a proper circadian lighting schedule that ensures higher light levels reaching the back of the eye are important for the aging population. For individuals with AD, a high CS value of 0.3-0.4 is suggested for the duration of daytime hours, only lower to 0.2 after 5 PM. This will ensure stimulation not only for the circadian system, but for cognitive functioning as well. This light can be delivered using light tables, which has been shown by Figueiro MG, et al to improve sleep, depression, and agitation in patients with AD.

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Eye diseases</h6>

        <p>
          Optical (pre-retinal) and neural (age related) eye diseases are the most common reason for impaired visibility. The prevailing causes are presbyopia and cataracts (optical), and glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy (neural). Lighting design tactics can be used strategically to provide the most comfort and visibility. The chart below gives a quick overview of design tactics that could be implemented.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Cataratcts - The overall blurring and yellowing of lens</h6>

        <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/4.png" class="float-right w-50 mx-4 rounded" alt="" /></figure>
        <p>
          Complication- With the accumulation of exposure to UV radiation during a lifetime, a yellow film is attained in the lenses of the eyes. Light is absorbed and scattered resulting in clouded vision and glare. A consequence of this is the decline of being able to discriminate colors, as well as reduced visual acuity within the entire field of vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lighting application- A cooler CCT could be used to combat the perception of yellowing due to the yellow filter from the lens.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Presbyopia - The aging of the eye</h6>

        <p>
          Complication: Presbyopia is a pre-retinal complication that is simply the natural aging of the lens. The ability to focus at different distances is lost, which is why reading glasses are needed. To combat this loss, at least 500 lux on task surfaces should be reached (according to the ANSI/IES RP-28-16 recommendations).
        </p>
        <p>
          Lighting application: Color contrast of materials within spaces should also be implemented to create discrimination between thresholds and changes within the space.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Pupillary miosis - Reduction in pupil size</h6>

        <p>
          Complication: Pupillary miosis is the reduction of average pupil size which becomes less responsive to changing light levels. Since the pupil controls how much light is let into the eye, this causes less light overall to get in the eye. If less light is actually getting in the eye, many things are compromised including circadian stimulation from light.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Glaucoma - Loss in peripheral vision</h6>

        <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/5.png" class="float-right w-22 mx-4 rounded" alt="" /></figure>
        <p>
          Complication: This neural disease causes an increased fluid pressure inside the eyeball, which causes vision loss especially in the peripheral vision. This becomes a problem, especially with being able to detect surroundings (e.g. when driving). The ability to see in dark atmospheres is also compromised due to less rod contribution to vision. Contrast sensitivity declines as well, which results in the inability to distinguish between colors and spaces that are close in color or gradient. Ability to adapt to changing light levels is reduced also.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lighting application: Since the disease destroys the photoreceptors, light cannot bring them back, but rather can enhance the activation of the remaining photoreceptors. Overall ambient light levels are important to keep high, as well as light cues at night when an older adult is navigating the space to the bathroom. Discrimination around thresholds is helpful too.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Macular Degeneration - Loss in central vision</h6>

        <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/6.png" class="float-right w-50 mx-4 rounded" alt="" /></figure>
        <p>
          Complication: This neural disease affects sharp central vision, which is what is used to see fine detail. For this reason, peripheral vision is more relied on. Since short wavelength cones are only present outside the fovea, sensitivity is potentially greater (*fact check*). The use of a cooler CCT may benefit an individual with this complication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lighting application: Need a lot of light to see
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Diabetic Retinopathy - Random blocking of vision</h6>

        <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/7.png" class="float-right w-50 mx-4 rounded" alt="" /></figure>
        <p>
          Complication: This neural disease is caused by diabetes creating complications in the retina by damaging blood vessels due to deprivation of oxygen and nutrients which in turn causes them to leak. Hemorrhages are then formed by the ruptured blood vessels, and black spots appear sporadically over the field of vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lighting application: Since vision is sporadically blocked, light levels should be sufficient for task as well as navigation.
        </p>

        <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Reduce falls</h6>

        <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/8.png" class="float-right w-30 mx-4 rounded" alt="" /></figure>
        <p>
          In addition to impacting our circadian system, light reveals the many intersecting spatial planes that make up the environment. Architectural features can be used to provide information about the environment and therefore improve navigation in the space. Light reveals visual information by providing a spatial reference for self-position and location of obstacles within a person’s surroundings. For example, removal of visual cues by closing the eyes has been shown to result in increased body sway. , Therefore, lighting schemes that reveal or enhance architectural features should be used to aid navigation and orientation in the built environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nightlights that both reduce the risk of falls and help to maintain sleep should be used. The nightlights should provide dim illumination to the local environment (1 to 3 lux at the cornea), but also provide enhanced spatial perceptual information about the surroundings. Nightlights accent the rectilinear architectural features in the room, highlighting essential vertical and horizontal information people need to promote postural stability while navigating in an otherwise dim environment. Since the nightlights are only on when motion is detected, they do not require the occupant to search blindly for a light switch that, when found, would then activate a bright, ambient lighting system. They are on only when a person needs to move through the space at night.
