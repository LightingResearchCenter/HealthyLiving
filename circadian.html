          figueiro et al. have proposed a 24-hour lighting scheme that maximizes circadian stimulation during the day and minimizes it at night, while maintaining good visibility at any time. The evidence suggests that high circadi-an stimulation during daytime waking hours can probably be achieved by receiving about 400 lux at the cornea of a 6500 K (cool-white) light source. Relatively dim ambient evening light (less than 30 lux at the eye) can be provided by light sources such as a 2700 K (warm-white) light source.

          Throughout a day, daylight is dynamic in its associated CCT (correlated color temperature) along with intensity (bright-ness). Its robust routine starts with a sunrise around 2000 K, and early morning sun around 3500 K. Late morning and aernoon daylight reaches 6000 K, and on a blue-sky day, 10000 K. The ladder down for the remainder of the day is mirrored, ending with dark skies, indicating that it is time for sleep. Being able to simulate the spectral qualities of sun-light and intensity throughout the day would provide the maximum eiciency for circadian rhythms. However, interior spaces don’t always have windows that can provide an entire space with the desired eect of sunlight, and light schedules are typically dominated by electric lighting. The most eective and eicacious electric lighting schedule would provide dynamic CCT and intensity throughout a day, with fixture spacing and distribution eicient for delivering the light to the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a dynamic CCT system is not available, a CS schedule can still be achieved using a single CCT that is dimmed for enhancement of a robust light/dark schedule. Since cooler CCTs (6500 K or 5000 K) have higher peaks in the ‘blue’ wavelengths (450-485 nm), these CCTs will have a larger impact on the CS scale and achieve 0.3-0.4 CS at lower light levels when compared to a warmer CCT, due to the peak spectral sensitivity of the circadian system being 460 nm.  Since cooler CCTs such as 6500 K have more area or ‘power’ in the SPD curve under the shorter wavelengths (when compared to 2700 K), it will have a stronger eect on the on the biological clock. If overhead lighting alone is unable to provide suicient light levels to the eye to reach high CS levels, personal light devices are a great alternative. These devices can be placed on a desk or work area in front of an individual and provide extra light stimulus. In the morning hours, the light device can provide 30 lux of monochromatic blue light at the eye.

        <p>
          High circadian stimulation during the day and low circadian stimulation during the evening can be achieved using a combination of daylight and electric light sources. Daylight can certainly be an eective light source for regulating the circadian system. Outdoor lighting has the ideal quantity, spectrum, distribution, timing, and duration, but it should not be assumed that daylight in buildings will always provide people with a suitable circadian light pattern. Again, a quantitative analysis of daylight in the space should be carefully made because the amount of daylight varies considerably throughout a building. Daylight levels in a room drop very quickly as the distance from the window increases; daylight levels are quite low 3-4 meters away from a window, even on a sunny day. It should also be noted that if sunlight from the window penetrates the room, discomfort glare may cause occupants to draw blinds or shades, eliminating daylight entirely from the space. Since it cannot be assumed that daylight in buildings is always going to be a solution for circadian entrainment, electric light must always be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relatively dim evening lighting scheme is entirely consistent with current lighting recommendations and practice, and although the light levels recommended for daytime applica-tions are relatively high compared to current practice, they are not diicult to achieve, particularly if controls are incorporated into the design.

        <p>
          Work plane height is the height of the horizontal plane in which a person does tasks. This can include tables, desks, and counters. Since task visibility is a key component in designing, it is important to know how much light will fall on these surfaces. Measuring how much light falls on task surfaces is called horizontal illuminance.
        </p>
        <p><b>Illuminance (E)</b> is the amount of luminous flux reaching a surface,  and is measured in lumens per square meter (lux) or lumens per square foot (footcandle). One footcandle is equal to about ten lux. Lighting designs are concerned with two types of illuminance values: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal and vertical illuminance are concerned with measuring the light that is received on a vertical or horizontal surface, such as the eye or work plane, respectively.</p>
        <figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/information about room/1.png" class="float-right w-50 p-4 m-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt="" /></figure>
        <p><b>Horizontal illuminance (EH)</b> is the light received on a surface, such as a table. These light levels are associated with the visual system and are concerned with light falling on a work plane to see a task. To measure horizontal illuminance, hold an illuminance meter horizontal with the sensor facing upwards. This will measure how much light is falling on the surface.</p>
        <p>
          Eye level height is concerned with how much light reaches the eye to impact the circadian system. Measuring how much light reaches the eye is called vertical illuminance.

          The CS (circadian Stimulus) metric developed by researchers at the Lighting Research Center (LRC)     is used to assess the eectiveness of a light source for stimulating the circadian system by measuring the suppression of the body’s production of melatonin resulting from exposure to that source. The accompanied graph shows the absolute sensitivity of the human circadian system plotted as a function of light level, where the spectral power distributions (SPDs) of various light sources used in previous published studies are weighted according to circadian light (CLA), shown on the x-axis. The y-axis on the right, labeled circadian stimulus (CS), is scaled to be proportional to the y-axis on the le, which shows the amount of melatonin suppressed aer exposing the retina for 1 hour, ranging from 0.1 (no measureable suppression) to a maximum of 0.7 (70% suppression). Several previous studies employing the CS metric and involving diverse populations have shown that exposure to high levels of circadian-eective light (CS > 0.30) during the day, particularly in the morning, is associated with improved sleep quality, mood, and circadian entrainment as well as greater subjective and objective alertness.      People who receive morning CS ≤ 0.10, on the other hand, are unlikely to be well synchronized to the natural day–night cycle and the various schedules that are associated with everyday life.
        </p>
        <figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/lighting solution/2.png" class="float-left w-50 p-4 m-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt="" /></figure>
        <p>
          Throughout a day, circadian designs target between &lt; 0.1 to 0.3 or 0.4 in a CS schedule (values above 0.4 have shown to plateau and not have any significant additional effect). When exposed for longer durations, a CS of 0.3 and above have been shown to suppress the production of melatonin (a sleep hormone that is released from the brain into the body approximately two hours before bedtime). Melatonin levels are designed to be low during the day due to the large amount of light that should be received at the eye, acting as a zeitgeber (time-giver) to tell the body it is not time to sleep. Since melatonin is an anticipatory hormone, meaning it will automatically be released about two hours prior to when the body thinks it is bedtime, the amount and type of light received during the day, as well as a person’s chronotype, determine when melatonin will be released at night. If a person is exposed in the later evening hours (past 5PM) to high light levels that correlate to a CS value above 0.3 for an extended period of time (>1 hour), the body will be tricked into thinking the day is not winding down, and melatonin release will continue to be pushed off. This can pose to be a problem especially when a person has social obligations to be on a time routine (i.e getting up for work in the morning). If a person has a hard time falling asleep and is woken up by an alarm, social jetlag can occur where a person feels tired and not in sync with social obligations or the solar day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brain’s circadian system cycles itself naturally every 24.2 hours, on average, so zeitgebers must be used to synchronize the body clock to the 24-hour solar day. The most influential zeitgeber is light, which when used properly can have a strong effect on the body feeling alert/awake, or tired/ready for sleep at the right times of day. Promoting a robust light/dark schedule, with achieving a CS between 0.3-0.4 in the first part of the day and reducing to below 0.1 at night will aid in the synchronization of the body to the solar day and social obligations.

      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>
          To achieve proper circadian entrainment, a 24-hour lighting schedule should be followed. This includes higher circadian stimulus in the early hours of the day that lowers in the evening hours. Schedules should start with either 0.3 or 0.4 targets and decrease throughout the day. Based on furniture and ultimately occupant location, a maximum target CS values of 0.3 or 0.4 should be determined. If occupant location and furniture layout is dynamic, it will be important to average a higher CS value to assure that a minimum of 0.3 is achieved where occupants may sit. However, for example, in a hospital room a patient location is known so a CS of 0.3 will need to be met at the bed. (Keep in mind, again, that patient’s orientation and therefore direction of gaze will vary in this scenario, so this should also be taken into account). All schedules should finish with a CS &lt; 0.1 during the nighttime hours to not cause circadian disruption.

        <p>
          Sunlight is dynamic throughout the day, changing color temperature (see below) as well as brightness. Using a dynamic system that shifts white light tint can be beneficial to achieve CS values most efficaciously. Cooler white light sources, such as 6500 K, include a higher peak of the short wavelength in white light, resulting it to have a bluer tint. Applying this CCT during the hours where 0.3 or 0.4 CS are desired will require less light that needs to reach the eye. At the end of the day when CS values should not exceed 0.1, a warmer CCT, such as 3000 K could be used since the wavelengths have less of an impact on the circadian system. This way, light levels on the work plane can still be bright enough for task visibility. If a system uses multiple CCTs, it is called a color tunable system. Dimming a single CCT is termed as a static system.

        <p>
          White light is made up of a combination of wavelengths in the visible spectrum, 380 nm- 780 nm. These wavelengths associate with colors that the eye perceives using the cone photoreceptors in the retina. Essentially, the photoreceptors in the eye receive the energy from photons and with the response of the photoreceptors it will be perceived as a certain color by the brain. The color figure depicts the color creation when the primary colors of light (blue, green, and red) overlap. When similar amounts of blue, green, and red wavelengths are combined, white light is created.
        </p>
        <p>
          A white light source can seem cooler (blue tint) or warmer (yellow tint), which is affiliated with its CCT (Correlated Color Temperature). CCT is associated with the color of light of a reference source when it is heated up to certain temperatures and is measured in degrees Kelvin (K). Typical CCT in designs can range from 2700 K (warmer white) to 6500 K (cooler white). Contrary to intuition, cooler (bluer) looking white light sources are physically hotter than warmer (yellower) looking light sources. Warmer white light is considered to be &lt; 3500 K and cooler white light is classified with sources >5000 K. The graphs below give a visual of example SPDs from LED light sources. Note that the color under the curve is given as a reference to better visualize how the associated wavelengths contribute to the varying tints of white light from an electric source. The warm-white 2700 K shows a larger area of contribution from the longer wavelengths, and less contribution from the short-wavelengths (bluer) making it appear warmer. Inversely, a cool-white 6500 K shows a greater peak in the shorter wavelengths, and a smaller area of long-wavelength contribution making it appear to have a bluer tint. SPDs for light sources all vary. SPD curves with a similar trend that appear to be the same tint will can be classified under the same CCT, but can possess different qualities that can affect outcomes such as CS and CRI. With this being the case, it is important to use the correct SPD of sources used in a design to determine its CS contribution.
        </p>

        <p>
          SPD, or spectral power distribution, graphs the amount of energy each wavelength has in a light source. Each light source is made up of a combination of wavelengths, ranging in strength, which is indicated by relative power on the y-axis. With white light being a combination of the spectral power of the many wavelengths, it is possible to have different SPDs that the brain perceives to be the same color. When the eye cannot distinguish the difference between a color that is made multiple ways, the light sources are called metamers.
        </p>
        <p>
          All light sources have a unique SPD. for example, when typical incandescent light bulbs operate, the glow of the heated tungsten filament operates at a warmer CCT between 2600 K and 3500 K. HID lamps (high-intensity discharge) contain multiple gasses such as argon, nitrogen, xenon, and metals such as sodium and mercury. Slightly different combinations of these filaments can cause alterations to the emitted wavelengths, and concurrently its initial SPD. The filaments within fluorescents are exhausted at different rates, so over time the wavelengths the source emits change, making the lamp appear to be different colors over its lifespan. fluorescents can begin to appear to have a greener or pinker tint depending on which filaments are left to be heated. It is important to know how a lamp is going to operate throughout its lifespan and the characteristics that impact its SPD. The SPD of light sources is an important component for determining its contribution to the circadian system. With LEDs, it is possible to create any SPD curve. This can be used strategically to create light sources that impact CS levels most efficaciously.

        <p>
          The CCT can have a large impact on how the overall atmosphere of a space feels. Even if horizontal and vertical illuminance values are the same, a space can feel brighter or dingier simply if a different CCT is used. A space can give a more concentrated, alert feel if a cooler CCT is used, compared to a warmer CCT that can make a space feel more welcoming and relaxed. Both cool and warm CCTs have their advantages that depend on the space, time of day, and user preference. Note that the brightness of light and reflectance off materials in the space also contributes to the ‘feel’ of the atmosphere.

          fixture type is an important decision in any design. There is a balance between aesthetically pleasing light fixtures that commonly want to provide adequate lighting for task visibility (horizontal illuminance). Another fundamental component to design for is light that stimulates the circadian system (vertical illuminance). Creating layers of light in a space would provide the most benefit for all desired components. fixtures of higher lumen output with distributions that provide the most light to the eye should be placed in locations near occupants.

          The distribution and intensity of light coming out of a fixture will determine how much light gets to the eye. A candela plot shows different cuts of a light fixture to understand how it will distribute light. Typically, a vertical cut (shown in blue) indicates the shape and intensity of light that will be distributed down into a space. The horizontal cut (shown in red) indicates the shape and intensity of light if you were looking at a light source from above.

          Direct versus indirect lighting simply indicates which direction light fixture project light. Typical fixtures are placed in the ceiling and send light downward into the space providing ‘direct’ light, such as a troffer, downlight, and recessed linear. To reduce glare from direct view of the source, lighting fixtures can be hidden in the architecture or fixture housing. If fixtures are oriented upwards, it is considered ‘indirect’ lighting. Coves and wall valances can hide upward facing fixtures and light will bounce off the ceiling or walls to more gently fill the space with light. Some fixtures can provide both direct (task) illumination as well as indirect (ambient) lighting. An example would be a direct/indirect linear pendant or wall mounted valance.

      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>
          The number of fixtures in a design can be general or strategic. Typically, a general fixture layout provides a uniform distribution of light throughout an entire space. If fixtures are located in respect to occupant location, the number of fixtures could decrease. Number of fixtures is also dependent on its beam distribution, mounting height, lumen output, fixture spacing, and SPD.

        <p>
          Throughout a fixture’s lifespan, light output naturally depreciates, resulting in reduction in light contribution. Some of these light loss factors include lumen or dirt depreciation. These factors will vary per fixture, but should be taken into account so that towards the end of lamp life, light levels to reach CS are still being achieved.

        <p>
          Doing light calculations before installation is beneficial to determine the most ideal fixtures and layout to implement into a design. Many iterations and fixtures can be quickly tested to predict how light will interact in a space. Modeling your space to include furniture location and material reflectance will give a good estimate as to light levels that will be achieved at specified locations. An available software for modeling a space and calculating light is AGi. Tutorials should be done to assure proper modeling and calculating techniques.

          The CS calculator developed by the LRC provides a way to plug in information about a light source to determine its impact on the circadian system. Once vertical illuminance values are found using AGi, and an SPD is determined, those values can be plugged into the calculator to measure CS. If multiple SPDs are used in a design, vertical illuminance contribution can be calculated separately and individually put into the calculator to see its combined measure.

        <p>
          Determining a control system for the lights is crucial for circadian design. At minimum, a lighting system should dim throughout the day to lower CS. This dimming is based on the CS schedule and can be on a time-based timing system. If a color tunable system is in place, the control system should change CCT and dim to reach predetermined light levels.

          One of the major recent advances in light and health research is the LRC&#39;s development of the Daysimeter, a research tool for measuring personal circadian light exposures and daily rest and activity levels. The Daysimeter is a one-of-a-kind practical device, as it measures circadian light based on a model of human circadian phototransduction proposed by the LRC, and is calibrated in terms of both photopic lux and circadian illuminance (a term based on the spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system.) Through use of the Daysimeter and associated software, LRC researchers are able to interpret light as a stimulus to the circadian system, quantify circadian disruption and circadian stimulus, and prescribe light treatments for adjusting circadian phase. Named one of the Top Ten Innovations of 2011, the Daysimeter and its smaller counterpart, the Daysimeter-D, are valuable tools in furthering our understanding of light&#39;s impact on human health.

      <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>
          Lighting Power Density, or LPD, refers to how much energy is being used to light a room. It is measured in watts (from the light source) per square foot (of the room), taking into account number of fixtures and CCT multiplier. LPD standards are defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). The codes are concerned with the maximum instantaneous LPD for a day. To reach the desired CS of 0.3-0.4, LPD will decrease when using CCTs that require less light output (less lumens from a fixture).

          The energy of a system can be estimated knowing the total wattage used for a period of time. When dimming a system throughout the day for a circadian design, less wattage is being used which will save energy. Energy usage is defined in terms of kilowatt-hours (kWh).
