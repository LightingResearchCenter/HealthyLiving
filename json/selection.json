      "desc": "A dynamic lighting system involves the dimming of a lighting system throughout the day to achieve target CS values. Another component of dynamic lighting is the CCT (correlated color temperature), using a range of white light from cooler white to warmer white. Color changing by using multiple CCTs throughout the day is characterized as a tunable CCT system, while using a single CCT that dims throughout the day is a static CCT system. Using RGB LED light sources allows for the opportunity to create any CCT, but be sure to use the CS calculator to determine your CCT’s contribution to CS.",
