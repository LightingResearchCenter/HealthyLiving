                    The visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum includes wavelength between 380-780 nm that mechanisms in the human eye are sensitive to. The retina in the human eye can absorb these wavelengths, interpret them, and send signals to the brain to perceive. Visual interpretation components allow us to ‘see’ the environment around us, but light can do much more. Acting as a catalyst, light can provide the awareness for the body to know what time of day it is as well as a stimulus for an acute alerting effect.

                    The 24-hour pattern of light and dark that accompanies Earth’s rotation regulates the physiology or behavior of almost every living thing on the planet. For humans, light reaching the back of our eyes is the main stimulus that synchronizes the biological clock and thus our body’s circadian rhythms to the solar day, telling our bodies to do the right thing at the right time. Sleeping and waking, feeding and fasting, the regulation of body temperature and blood pressure, and the secretion of hormones are just a few examples of circadian rhythms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what light gives, light can take away. Exposure to light at the wrong times, which has become increasingly common since the advent of electrical lighting over a century ago, can desynchronize our circadian rhythms. Exposure to light at night (LAN), for example, is now a fact of life in out 24-hour society, and has been linked with poor sleep and health problems including certain types of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Adversely, not getting enough light throughout the day will cause the biological system (naturally cycling on an average of 24.2 hours) to not synchronize with the 24-hour solar day, making it lag behind. Without social commitments demanding us to sleep and wake up at certain times, the circadian system would become completely out of sync with the solar day.

                    Sleep pressure naturally accumulates over the hours we are awake, and will decline during sleeping hours. To keep ourselves awake during the day, the body overcomes sleep pressure with alerting signals that are regulated by the circadian system. At a certain time of day, the magnitude of the alerting signal is not high enough to combat sleep pressure, and what is known as a ‘post-lunch dip’ occurs. A post-lunch dip occurs between 2-4pm, or 16-18 hours after a person went to bed the night before. This is why people can feel tired and unproductive around this time of day. To compensate for this, the LRC has shown the impact of using red light to have an alerting effect, without disruption of the circadian system. Using a personal light device contributing 50 lux of monochromatic red light at the eye has been shown to increase alertness. Similar to a cup of coffee, light can have acute alerting effects.

                    Hormones are the signals sent as messages from the brain and into the body. Melatonin and cortisol are inverse hormones released at specific times of the day. Melatonin is released at night as an ‘activity to non-activity’ signal to get the body to wind down and sleep. Cortisol  is the signal in the morning to get the body ready for the change from non-activity to activity, and begins to alert the body to wake up. Both are anticipatory hormones, meaning their signals are sent out in anticipation of sleep or wake time. Just like it is natural for the body to take between 10-20 minutes to fall asleep, the body should know to slowly wake itself up, rather than abruptly waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle.  For example, if a person has a rhythmic sleep/wake pattern and their natural wakeup time is 8 AM, cortisol will begin to be released at 6 AM, slowly waking the body up from its last REM cycle. A sharp peak of cortisol occurs 30-40 minutes after waking up. This is known as Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and is important to prepare the body for the upcoming day. If a person is sleep deprived, CAR is reduced, making it even harder for a person to feel awake in the morning and ready to start the day. In the morning, 800 lux of white light at the eye can increase cortisol levels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Melatonin and cortisol secretion from the brain is controlled by the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) which has a direct connection to the optic nerve, and input from the eye. This means that the input from light through the eye plays a large role in how the body’s circadian system communicates to the rest of the body.

                  <p>
                    The eye is a complex structure that is a visual relay system, taking messages from light energy, interpreting it, and sending signals to the brain for perceiving. Light first enters through the cornea where 2/3 of the bending of light happens at this air-to-cornea threshold. The eye is sensitive to the brightness of light, and the pupil changes in size to accommodate for the dynamic changes in light level throughout the day. The pupil will become a larger aperture in darker environments to let in more light in order to see better. Oppositely, in bright environments, such as a sunny day, the pupil decreases in size to reduce the discomfort from bright and glary sources. This expansion and contraction is controlled by the ciliary muscle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When light enters through the lens, since the lens is a convex shape, it will bend the light and direct it to the macula where it is focused.  The fovea is responsible for central vision, where we can detect fine detail and colors. It makes up 2 degrees of the whole retina, yet we rely on it heavily for discrimination of detail. The retina contains photoreceptors that are sensitive to wavelengths in the visible spectrum (approximately 380-780 nm). The way light within this spectrum interacts and bounces off surfaces and into the eye is what allows us to see. The tissues in retina are an extension of the brain, so it plays an important role in relaying information from the environment to the brain to perceive. Information that the photoreceptors in the retina perceive send signals through the optic nerve and into the brain. Since there is a break in the retina where the optic nerve is located, the optic disc creates a blind spot.

                    Hormones are the signals sent as messages from the brain and into the body. Melatonin and cortisol are inverse hormones released at specific times of the day. Melatonin is released at night as an ‘activity to non-activity’ signal to get the body to wind down and sleep. Cortisol  is the signal in the morning to get the body ready for the change from non-activity to activity, and begins to alert the body to wake up. Both are anticipatory hormones, meaning their signals are sent out in anticipation of sleep or wake time. Just like it is natural for the body to take between 10-20 minutes to fall asleep, the body should know to slowly wake itself up, rather than abruptly waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle.  For example, if a person has a rhythmic sleep/wake pattern and their natural wakeup time is 8 AM, cortisol will begin to be released at 6 AM, slowly waking the body up from its last REM cycle. A sharp peak of cortisol occurs 30-40 minutes after waking up. This is known as Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and is important to prepare the body for the upcoming day. If a person is sleep deprived, CAR is reduced, making it even harder for a person to feel awake in the morning and ready to start the day. In the morning, 800 lux of white light at the eye can increase cortisol levels.

                    Melatonin and cortisol secretion from the brain is controlled by the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) which has a direct connection to the optic nerve, and input from the eye. This means that the input from light through the eye plays a large role in how the body’s circadian system communicates to the rest of the body.

                    The visible spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum contains wavelengths that a human’s eyeball is able to perceive. In other words, they speak the same language, and the mechanisms in the eye translate these signals for the brain to interpret.

                    For colors to be visible, a mechanism that can interpret the wavelengths must be in place. That is where the photoreceptors in the eye come into play. The eye is made up of photoreceptors in the fovea (central vision) and the surrounding retina (peripheral vision). The human eye has an inverted retina, meaning light goes past all the layers to the pigment epithelium layer which is located in the back of the retina. Here, it gets absorbed and sent back through the layers and exits through the optic nerve. Within the retina, color is distinguished by the cone photoreceptors. The eye contains three cone photoreceptors: long-, medium-, and short-wavelength cones. Each have a range of wavelengths they are sensitive to, and have a peak wavelength sensitivity. Long-wavelength cones have a peak sensitivity at 564 nm, medium-wavelength cones at 533 nm, and short-wavelength cones at 437 nm. As seen in the figure below, each photoreceptor has a range of wavelengths that they are sensitive to and will activate a response. The y-axis on the graph associates with how much absorption of light each photoreceptor is capable of at each wavelength.

                  <p>
                    Knowing these wavelengths associate to perceived color in the visible spectrum, the combination of signals all the cones receive go through the Bipolar “connector” cell layer that takes combined signals from different photoreceptors throughout the retina. The Ganglion layer then communicates with multiple bipolar layers to determine what electrical signal it wants to send to the brain. An oversimplification, but the takeaway is that the messages sent to the brain go through multiple layers of communication with one another, getting feedback and deciding on what message it will send to the brain. The brain then interprets this signal to determine what colors and image it sees. The figure depicts the connections of the components in the retina and the process light undergoes when traveling through the retina.

                    In addition to cones, another photoreceptor in the retina are rods that are activated in dim light conditions (< ___ lux). Rods are absent in the fovea (central vision) and only present in the surrounding retina. The retina contains about 120 million rods and 8 million cones.  The ratio of L:M:S cones is 32:16:1.</p>

                    If you look at a dark sky at night, you will notice that you can only see very dim stars in your peripheral vision. This is because only your rods can detect such low light levels. If you try to look directly at it, it will seem to disappear because your central vision is only made up of cones that need higher light levels to be activated. This also explains that when your vision adapts to the dark when you’re outside at night, you can’t see color because cones don’t activate at such low light levels. The figure below shows a graph of the amount and distribution of rods and cones in the retina, with the center of the fovea being 0 degrees.

                    In addition to rods and cones, the retina contains a recently discovered third type of photoreceptor whose focus is not visual perception, but is rather concerned with the circadian system. ipRGCs, or intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are not located in the photoreceptor layer with the rods and cones. They are located in the layer right before the optic nerve and have a 1:1 connection to the brain, which is different than the L, M, and S cones. That means the signal the ipRGC gets goes directly to the part of the brain that is responsible for circadian entrainment. These photoreceptors also connect back to other layers and receive input from the other photoreceptors. ipRGCs have a peak spectral sensitivity of 484 nm within the short-wavelength range, which is why the circadian system is more sensitive to shorter (blue) wavelengths and considered a “blue sky detector.” Light sources that contain higher concentration of shorter wavelengths, and less in the longer wavelengths in their SPD will have a larger impact on circadian entrainment.
