                    The visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum includes wavelength between 380-780 nm that mechanisms in the human eye are sensitive to. The retina in the human eye can absorb these wavelengths, interpret them, and send signals to the brain to perceive. Visual interpretation components allow us to ‘see’ the environment around us, but light can do much more. Acting as a catalyst, light can provide the awareness for the body to know what time of day it is as well as a stimulus for an acute alerting effect. The <a class="segue" href="#section-lightingAndTheCircadianSystem">circadian system</a> is responsible for synchronizing the body around ('circa') the day ('dia').

                    The 24-hour pattern of light and dark that accompanies Earth’s rotation regulates the physiology or behavior of almost every living thing on the planet. For humans, light reaching the back of our eyes is the main stimulus that synchronizes the biological clock and thus our body’s circadian rhythms to the solar day, telling our bodies to do the right thing at the right time. Sleeping and waking, feeding and fasting, the regulation of body temperature and blood pressure, and the secretion of hormones are just a few examples of circadian rhythms.
                  </p>
                  <figure><img src="img/background/fundamentals/lighting and the circadian system/2.png" class="float-left w-50 drop-shadow rounded p-4 pl-0 m-4" alt="" /></figure>
                  <p>
                    There are a few exogenous (external) cues that aid the body in knowing what time of day it is for the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. With food intake and exercise being two cues, light through the eye has been shown to be the most effective time-giver for the circadian clock. The circadian system is responsible for regulating all cyclic rhythms within the body, which is why it is known as the master clock. If the master clock isn’t given a robust schedule of cues, it cannot regulate a proper schedule. Without proper cues from light exposure, especially, the circadian system would be left in a state of circadian darkness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Light’s effects on the circadian system should be taken into consideration when designing lighting to benefit the well-being of occupants of any interior space. Disturbing the daily or circadian (circa = “about,” dies = “day”) pattern of light and dark can adversely affect our basic health and well-being and negatively influence some measures of performance. The use of architectural lighting to sustain the circadian pattern of light and dark has shown therapeutic value in laboratory and field studies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Four characteristics of light are crucial for the circadian system’s response to light:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>1.&nbsp;</b> The amount or level of light received at the eyes (“bright or dim?”)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>2.&nbsp;</b> The spectral properties of the light experienced (“warm or cool?”)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>3.&nbsp;</b> The timing and duration of light exposures (“when, and for how long?”)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>4.&nbsp;</b> A person’s history of light exposures (“how much over the past 24 hours?”)
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When appropriately specified according to these four characteristics, light exposures can reduce symptoms of seasonal affective disorder, [1] increase sleep efficiency in older adults (including those with Alzheimer’s disease), [2-4] promote circadian entrainment in premature infants, [5] and increase alertness at all times of day and night. [6-8]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The studies cited above used bright polychromatic white light of a high correlated color temperature (CCT) or short-wavelength (460 nm) light. And it is not just about short-wavelength (blue) light. Recent research shows that long-wavelength (red) light, which does not affect melatonin levels at night, can increase objective and subjective measures of alertness as well as certain types of performance. Light during the day can also affect alertness and certain types of performance. Figueiro and colleagues showed that about 200 lux at the eye of a warm white light (2650 K) and 260 lux of a 640-nm light increased alertness and certain types of performance during the post-lunch dip hours. It has even been suggested that some forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease may be linked to the disruption of the normal circadian light-dark pattern. The impact of light on the general population is less clear. More recent studies suggest that daylight in office buildings can increase sleep in workers, but further investigation about the effect of light on the general population is warranted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what light gives, light can take away. Exposure to light at the wrong times, which has become increasingly common since the advent of electrical lighting over a century ago, can desynchronize our circadian rhythms. Exposure to light at night (LAN), for example, is now a fact of life in our 24-hour society, and has been linked with poor sleep and health problems including certain types of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Adversely, not getting enough light throughout the day will cause the biological system (naturally cycling on an average of 24.2 hours) to not synchronize with the 24-hour solar day, making it lag behind. Without social commitments demanding us to sleep and wake up at certain times, the circadian system would become completely out of sync with the solar day, functioning on a free-running schedule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The examples below present good and bad lighting scenes. Typical commercial and residential lighting is considered bad lighting for circadian entrainment since it is lacks robust light levels.

                    Sleep pressure naturally accumulates over the hours we are awake, and will decline during sleeping hours. To keep ourselves awake during the day, the body overcomes sleep pressure with alerting signals that are regulated by the circadian system. At a certain time of day, the magnitude of the alerting signal is not high enough to combat sleep pressure, and what is known as a ‘post-lunch dip’ occurs. A post-lunch dip occurs between 2-4pm, or 16-18 hours after a person went to bed the night before. This is why people can feel tired and unproductive around this time of day. To compensate for this, the LRC has shown the impact of using red light to have an alerting effect, without disruption of the circadian system. Using a personal light device contributing 50 lux of monochromatic red light at the eye has been shown to increase alertness. Similar to a cup of coffee, light can have acute alerting effects.

                    Hormones are the signals sent as messages from the brain and into the body. Melatonin and cortisol have inverse functions and released at differing times from one another. Melatonin is released at night as an ‘activity to non-activity’ signal, in humans, to get the body to wind down and sleep. Cortisol is the signal in the morning, for humans, to get the body ready for the change from non-activity to activity, and begins to alert the body to wake up. Melatonin is an anticipatory hormone, meaning its signals are sent out in anticipation of sleep time. The body is told that it is time to wind down with the process the process called dim light melatonin onset, or DLMO which occurs during nighttime hours and in dark conditions. And just like it is natural for the body to take between 10-20 minutes to fall asleep, the body should know to slowly wake itself up, rather than abruptly waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle. For example, if a person has a rhythmic sleep/wake pattern where bedtime is 11 PM and wake time is 7 AM, melatonin will begin to be released at 9 PM to instruct the body to start winding down. Melatonin levels will begin to drop in the early morning hours so the body will begin to wake itself up from its last REM cycle. A sharp peak of cortisol occurs 30-40 minutes after waking up , which is known as Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and is important to prepare the body for the upcoming day. Have you ever stayed up late in anticipation of sleeping in on the weekend after a long week of waking up at 6 AM for work only to find that you still wake up at 6 AM? This means that your body has a regulated sleep/wake cycle which is actually healthy. On the contrary, a sleepy Monday morning rolls around and your body is not ready to wake up at that time. Or if you are sleep deprived in general, CAR is reduced, making it even harder for a person to feel awake in the morning and ready to start the day. A few cups of coffee is one way to block the neurotransmitter in the brain that causes tiredness, but receiving morning white light at 800 lux at the eye can increase cortisol levels and in turn, alertness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the brain does not receive enough light through the eye in the morning hours, alertness and entrainment to the solar day will not occur. This entrainment process is known as phase advancing the circadian clock to be in line with the solar day. Furthermore, receiving too bright of light in the evening hours before bed will phase delay the circadian clock, pushing off the release of melatonin. Overall, being exposed to a proper robust light/dark schedule will entrain your body to the solar day as well as your daily schedule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of the hormones that are the internal messengers for the body, melatonin and cortisol secretion from the brain is controlled by the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) which has a direct connection to the optic nerve, and input from the eye. This means that the input from <a class="segue" href="#section-structureOfTheEye">light through the eye</a> plays a large role in how the body’s circadian system communicates to the rest of the body.

                    The eye is a complex structure that is a visual relay system, taking messages from light energy, interpreting it, and sending signals to the brain for perceiving. Light first enters through the cornea where 2/3 of the bending of light happens at this air-to-cornea threshold. The eye is sensitive to the brightness of light, and the pupil changes in size to accommodate for the dynamic changes in light level throughout the day. The pupil will become a larger aperture in darker environments to let in more light in order to see better. Oppositely, in bright environments, such as a sunny day, the pupil decreases in size to reduce the discomfort from bright and glary sources. This expansion and contraction is controlled by the ciliary muscle.

                  <p>
                    When light enters through the convex shaped lens, it will bend the light and direct it to the macula where it is focused. The fovea is responsible for sharp central vision, where we can detect fine detail and colors. It makes up 2 degrees of the whole retina, yet we rely on it heavily for discrimination of detail. The retina contains <a class="segue" href="#section-structureOfTheRetina">photoreceptors that are sensitive to wavelengths in the visible spectrum</a> (approximately 380-780 nm). The way light within this spectrum interacts and bounces off surfaces and into the eye is what allows us to see. The tissues in retina are an extension of the brain, so it plays an important role in relaying information from the environment to the brain to perceive. Information that the photoreceptors in the retina perceive send signals through the optic nerve and into the brain. Since there is a break in the retina where the optic nerve is located, the optic disc creates a blind spot.

                    The visible spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum contains wavelengths that a human’s eyeball is able to perceive. In other words, they speak the same language, and the mechanisms in the eye translate these signals for the brain to interpret.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For colors to be visible, a mechanism that can interpret the wavelengths must be in place. That is where the photoreceptors in the eye come into play. The eye is made up of photoreceptors in the fovea (central vision) and the surrounding retina (peripheral vision). The human eye has an inverted retina, meaning light goes past all the layers to the pigment epithelium layer which is located in the back of the retina. Here, it gets absorbed and sent back through the layers and exits through the optic nerve. Within the retina, color is distinguished by the cone photoreceptors. The eye contains three cone photoreceptors: long-, medium-, and short-wavelength cones. Each have a range of wavelengths they are sensitive to, and have a peak wavelength sensitivity. Long-wavelength cones have a peak sensitivity at 564 nm, medium-wavelength cones at 533 nm, and short-wavelength cones at 437 nm. As seen in the figure below, each photoreceptor has a range of wavelengths that they are sensitive to and will activate a response. The y-axis on the graph associates with how much absorption of light each photoreceptor is capable of at each wavelength.

                  <p>
                    Knowing these wavelengths associate to perceived color in the visible spectrum, the combination of signals all the cones receive go through the Bipolar “connector” cell layer that takes combined signals from different photoreceptors throughout the retina. The Ganglion layer then communicates with multiple bipolar layers to determine what electrical signal it wants to send to the brain. An oversimplification, but the takeaway is that the messages sent to the brain go through multiple layers of communication with one another, getting feedback and deciding on what message it will send to the brain. The brain then interprets this signal to determine what colors and image it ‘sees.’ Cones are unable to perceptive low light levels, so <a class="segue" href="#section-rodsAndCones">rods, another type of photoreceptor</a>, will take over to distinguish between light and dark. The figure above depicts the connections of the components in the retina and the process light undergoes when traveling through the retina.

Rods are absent in the fovea (central vision) and only present in the surrounding retina. The retina contains about 120 million rods and 8 million cones.  The ratio of L:M:S cones is 32:16:1.</p>

                    If you look at a dark sky at night, you will notice that you can only see very dim stars in your peripheral vision. This is because only your rods can detect such low light levels. If you try to look directly at it, it will seem to disappear because your central vision is only made up of cones that need higher light levels to be activated. This also explains that when your vision adapts to the dark when you’re outside at night, you can’t see color because cones don’t activate at such low light levels. The figure below shows a graph of the amount and distribution of rods and cones in the retina, with the center of the fovea being 0 degrees.

                        In addition to rods and cones, the retina contains a recently discovered third type of photoreceptor whose focus is not visual perception, but is rather concerned with the circadian system. ipRGCs, or intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are not located in the photoreceptor layer with the rods and cones. They are located in the layer right before the optic nerve and have a 1:1 connection to the brain, which is different than the L, M, and S cones. That means the signal the ipRGC gets goes directly to the part of the brain that is responsible for circadian entrainment. These photoreceptors also connect back to other layers and receive input from the other photoreceptors.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        ipRGCs have a peak spectral sensitivity of 484 nm within the short-wavelength range, which is why the circadian system is more sensitive to shorter (blue) wavelengths and considered a “blue sky detector.” Light sources that contain higher concentration of shorter wavelengths, and less in the longer wavelengths in their SPD will have a larger impact on circadian entrainment.

                    Visual and non-visual parts of the brain receive information from the eye. The LMS cones and rods are responsible for instantaneous responses to light for visual purposes. The visual cortex is located in the back of the brain. The ipRGCs send its input directly to the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) which is the location of the master circadian clock in the forefront of the brain. Though this connection is direct, the circadian (non-visual) system itself is slower to respond to light signals than the visual system. It is important to create lighting designs that accommodate for both visual and non-visual needs occupants.

                    Figueiro et al. have proposed a 24-hour lighting scheme that maximizes circadian stimulation during the day and minimizes it at night, while maintaining good visibility at any time. The evidence suggests that high circadi-an stimulation during daytime waking hours can probably be achieved by receiving about 400 lux at the cornea of a 6500 K (cool-white) light source. Relatively dim ambient evening light (less than 30 lux at the eye) can be provided by light sources such as a 2700 K (warm-white) light source.

                    Throughout a day, daylight is dynamic in its associated CCT (correlated color temperature) along with intensity (brightness). Its robust routine starts with a sunrise around 2000 K, and early morning sun around 3500 K. Late morning and aernoon daylight reaches 6000 K, and on a blue-sky day, 10000 K. The ladder down for the remainder of the day is mirrored, ending with dark skies, indicating that it is time for sleep. Being able to simulate the spectral qualities of sun-light and intensity throughout the day would provide the maximum efficiency for circadian rhythms. However, interior spaces don’t always have windows that can provide an entire space with the desired eect of sunlight, and light schedules are typically dominated by electric lighting. The most eective and eicacious electric lighting schedule would provide dynamic CCT and intensity throughout a day, with fixture spacing and distribution eicient for delivering the light to the eye.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a dynamic CCT system is not available, a CS schedule can still be achieved using a single CCT that is dimmed for enhancement of a robust light/dark schedule. Since cooler CCTs (6500 K or 5000 K) have higher peaks in the ‘blue’ wavelengths (450-485 nm), these CCTs will have a larger impact on the CS scale and achieve 0.3-0.4 CS at lower light levels when compared to a warmer CCT, due to the peak spectral sensitivity of the circadian system being 460 nm.  Since cooler CCTs such as 6500 K have more area or ‘power’ in the SPD curve under the shorter wavelengths (when compared to 2700 K), it will have a stronger effect on the on the biological clock. If overhead lighting alone is unable to provide suicient light levels to the eye to reach high CS levels, personal light devices are a great alternative. These devices can be placed on a desk or work area in front of an individual and provide extra light stimulus. In the morning hours, the light device can provide 30 lux of monochromatic blue light at the eye.

                    High circadian stimulation during the day and low circadian stimulation during the evening can be achieved using a combination of daylight and electric light sources. Daylight can certainly be an eective light source for regulating the circadian system. Outdoor lighting has the ideal quantity, spectrum, distribution, timing, and duration, but it should not be assumed that daylight in buildings will always provide people with a suitable circadian light pattern. Again, a quantitative analysis of daylight in the space should be carefully made because the amount of daylight varies considerably throughout a building. Daylight levels in a room drop very quickly as the distance from the window increases; daylight levels are quite low 3-4 meters away from a window, even on a sunny day. It should also be noted that if sunlight from the window penetrates the room, discomfort glare may cause occupants to draw blinds or shades, eliminating daylight entirely from the space. Since it cannot be assumed that daylight in buildings is always going to be a solution for circadian entrainment, electric light must always be considered.

                  <p>
                    The relatively dim evening lighting scheme is entirely consistent with current lighting recommendations and practice, and although the light levels recommended for daytime applica-tions are relatively high compared to current practice, they are not diicult to achieve, particularly if controls are incorporated into the design.

                    The circadian system is the master clock of the body. The most effective time-giver for the circadian clock in the brain is light through the eye. The circadian system naturally regulates itself on a 24.2-hour cycle, and bright light during the day, and more effectively blue light, or light containing a higher concentration of shorter wavelengths is important to advance your circadian clock to be in sync with the 24-hour solar day. Light that gets to the eye and contains qualities that stimulate the circadian system we call circadian stimulus (CS). This metric takes into account spectral qualities of a light and how much is needed at the eye to create a response. On a scale from 0.0-0.7, the target CS changes throughout the span of a day, starting with a higher CS during the daytime (between 0.3-0.4), and lower at night (< 0.1). Occupant type, time of day, and duration contribute to what CS should be targeted. The biological clock is responsible for keeping all hormones and bodily functions regulating on a cycle. A major one being melatonin, the sleep hormone. Being an anticipatory hormone, and in nighttime and circadian dark conditions, melatonin will be released 2 hours before your body thinks it’s bedtime. If you are not exposed to a robust light/dark schedule, your body is in constant circadian darkness and can’t regulate hormones at the proper time they’re supposed to be released. Short-term circadian disruption can cause social jet-lag, decreased performance, bad mood/behavior, and decreased alertness throughout the day. Long-term circadian disruption can lead to increased risk of sleep disorders, depression, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and even cancer. Whether you want to have a healthier diet, better exercise routine, more energy, better sleep, better mood, or reduced risk of disease, proper circadian entrainment is the origin to which these initiatives can be achieved.

                    When deciding on a CS schedule, it is important to consider certain parameters. Determining what maximum CS value to target and for how long is dependent on the occupant and his/her sleep wake cycle. This is based on the person’s chronotype or social/work schedule. Knowing a occupant’s schedule will help determine the time of day a person should be exposed to varying CS levels.

                  <p>
                    There are a few major lighting components that contribute to determining the CS value. The first one is Spectral Power distribution, or SPD. Since the circadian system is sensitive to shorter wavelengths, and more specifically ones close to 484 nm, the SPD plays an important role in calculating CS. Once the SPD is known, the target vertical illuminance (EV) values can be calculated using the CS calculator to determine what illuminance levels to target at the eye. The intensity distribution of a light source or multiple light sources in the room will determine how the light is distributed into the room and ultimately to the eye and work plane. And finally, the duration of exposure plays an important role in how the circadian system responds to the given light. It is found that it takes at least an hour of exposure to light providing a CS > 0.3 to have an effet on the circadian system.

                    There are many components to a circadian design. One of the major categories includes information about room, who occupies it, dimensions and reflectances of the room, and furniture location create the first steps. Creating a CS schedule and desired CCTs are pieces to the lighting solution. Figuring out fixture information gets closer to having all the components needed to start determining performance of the solution. Using a lighting design software and photometric files, predictions can be made for how the fixtures perform. In applied designs, we can see the accuracy of real-life application and the output information such as achieved CS levels, LPD, and energy usage. <a class="segue" href="#section-informationAboutRoom">Learn more about these specific components of circadian design below.</a>

Both have important roles in creating a successful circadian design, but differ in their contributions. For the most successful circadian design, a feedback loop should be created between manufacturers and designers to communicate the needs specific for each project. Read more about the steps that can be taken and their importance to circadian design. Like all designs, it will take a few iterations to come up with the optimal CS performance.

                  <p>What direction is your building and exposed walls of the room facing? How does daylight interact with the space? Depending on the time of year  and weather, daylight could be taken into consideration. Daylight sensors and a separeate zone to independently control light fixtures by the window could save energy while still promoting circadian entrainment. If there is set furniture locations, note where an occupant is facing. Daylight light levels for an occupant facing away from a window will contribute barely any CS.</p>

It is important to understand where to take illuminance measurements to reach the desired light levels required for target circadian stimulus values. If occupant location is known, illuminance calculations can concentrate on occupied areas. If occupant location is unknown or dynamic, illuminance calculations but be taken throughout the room to make sure the average illuminance at the eye is high enough to correspond to a CS above 0.3 when it is needed in the morning hours. Averaging 0.4 will better assure that more locations in the room will be at least 0.3.</p>

                    Work plane height is the height of the horizontal plane in which a person does tasks. This can include tables, desks, and counters. Since task visibility is a key component in designing, it is important to know how much light will fall on these surfaces. Measuring how much light falls on task surfaces is called horizontal illuminance.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Illuminance (E)</b> is the amount of luminous flux reaching a surface,  and is measured in lumens per square meter (lux) or lumens per square foot (footcandle). One footcandle is equal to about ten lux. Lighting designs are concerned with two types of illuminance values: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal and vertical illuminance are concerned with measuring the light that is received on a vertical or horizontal surface, such as the eye or work plane, respectively.</p>
                  <p><b>Horizontal illuminance (EH)</b> is the light received on a surface, such as a table. These light levels are associated with the visual system and are concerned with light falling on a work plane to see a task. To measure horizontal illuminance, hold an illuminance meter horizontal with the sensor facing upwards. This will measure how much light is falling on the surface.</p>
                  <p>
                    Eye level height is concerned with how much light reaches the eye to impact the circadian system. Measuring how much light reaches the eye is called vertical illuminance.

                    The CS (circadian Stimulus) metric developed by researchers at the Lighting Research Center (LRC)     is used to assess the eectiveness of a light source for stimulating the circadian system by measuring the suppression of the body’s production of melatonin resulting from exposure to that source. The accompanied graph shows the absolute sensitivity of the human circadian system plotted as a function of light level, where the spectral power distributions (SPDs) of various light sources used in previous published studies are weighted according to circadian light (CLA), shown on the x-axis. The y-axis on the right, labeled circadian stimulus (CS), is scaled to be proportional to the y-axis on the le, which shows the amount of melatonin suppressed aer exposing the retina for 1 hour, ranging from 0.1 (no measureable suppression) to a maximum of 0.7 (70% suppression). Several previous studies employing the CS metric and involving diverse populations have shown that exposure to high levels of circadian-eective light (CS > 0.30) during the day, particularly in the morning, is associated with improved sleep quality, mood, and circadian entrainment as well as greater subjective and objective alertness.      People who receive morning CS ≤ 0.10, on the other hand, are unlikely to be well synchronized to the natural day–night cycle and the various schedules that are associated with everyday life.

                    Throughout a day, circadian designs target between &lt; 0.1 to 0.3 or 0.4 in a CS schedule (values above 0.4 have shown to plateau and not have any significant additional effect). When exposed for longer durations, a CS of 0.3 and above have been shown to suppress the production of melatonin (a sleep hormone that is released from the brain into the body approximately two hours before bedtime). Melatonin levels are designed to be low during the day due to the large amount of light that should be received at the eye, acting as a zeitgeber (time-giver) to tell the body it is not time to sleep. Since melatonin is an anticipatory hormone, meaning it will automatically be released about two hours prior to when the body thinks it is bedtime, the amount and type of light received during the day, as well as a person’s chronotype, determine when melatonin will be released at night. If a person is exposed in the later evening hours (past 5PM) to high light levels that correlate to a CS value above 0.3 for an extended period of time (>1 hour), the body will be tricked into thinking the day is not winding down, and melatonin release will continue to be pushed off. This can pose to be a problem especially when a person has social obligations to be on a time routine (i.e getting up for work in the morning). If a person has a hard time falling asleep and is woken up by an alarm, social jetlag can occur where a person feels tired and not in sync with social obligations or the solar day.

                  <p>
                    The brain’s circadian system cycles itself naturally every 24.2 hours, on average, so zeitgebers must be used to synchronize the body clock to the 24-hour solar day. The most influential zeitgeber is light, which when used properly can have a strong effect on the body feeling alert/awake, or tired/ready for sleep at the right times of day. Promoting a robust light/dark schedule, with achieving a CS between 0.3-0.4 in the first part of the day and reducing to below 0.1 at night will aid in the synchronization of the body to the solar day and social obligations.

                    To achieve proper circadian entrainment, a 24-hour lighting schedule should be followed. This includes higher circadian stimulus in the early hours of the day that lowers in the evening hours. Schedules should start with either 0.3 or 0.4 targets and decrease throughout the day. Based on furniture and ultimately occupant location, a maximum target CS values of 0.3 or 0.4 should be determined. If occupant location and furniture layout is dynamic, it will be important to average a higher CS value to assure that a minimum of 0.3 is achieved where occupants may sit. However, for example, in a hospital room a patient location is known so a CS of 0.3 will need to be met at the bed. (Keep in mind, again, that patient’s orientation and therefore direction of gaze will vary in this scenario, so this should also be taken into account). All schedules should finish with a CS &lt; 0.1 during the nighttime hours to not cause circadian disruption.

                    Sunlight is dynamic throughout the day, changing color temperature (see below) as well as brightness. Using a dynamic system that shifts white light tint can be beneficial to achieve CS values most efficaciously. Cooler white light sources, such as 6500 K, include a higher peak of the short wavelength in white light, resulting it to have a bluer tint. Applying this CCT during the hours where 0.3 or 0.4 CS are desired will require less light that needs to reach the eye. At the end of the day when CS values should not exceed 0.1, a warmer CCT, such as 3000 K could be used since the wavelengths have less of an impact on the circadian system. This way, light levels on the work plane can still be bright enough for task visibility. If a system uses multiple CCTs, it is called a color tunable system. Dimming a single CCT is termed as a static system.

                    White light is made up of a combination of wavelengths in the visible spectrum, 380 nm- 780 nm. These wavelengths associate with colors that the eye perceives using the cone photoreceptors in the retina. Essentially, the photoreceptors in the eye receive the energy from photons and with the response of the photoreceptors it will be perceived as a certain color by the brain. The color figure depicts the color creation when the primary colors of light (blue, green, and red) overlap. When similar amounts of blue, green, and red wavelengths are combined, white light is created.

                    A white light source can seem cooler (blue tint) or warmer (yellow tint), which is affiliated with its CCT (Correlated Color Temperature). CCT is associated with the color of light of a reference source when it is heated up to certain temperatures and is measured in degrees Kelvin (K). Typical CCT in designs can range from 2700 K (warmer white) to 6500 K (cooler white). Contrary to intuition, cooler (bluer) looking white light sources are physically hotter than warmer (yellower) looking light sources. Warmer white light is considered to be &lt; 3500 K and cooler white light is classified with sources >5000 K. The graphs below give a visual of example SPDs from LED light sources. Note that the color under the curve is given as a reference to better visualize how the associated wavelengths contribute to the varying tints of white light from an electric source. The warm-white 2700 K shows a larger area of contribution from the longer wavelengths, and less contribution from the short-wavelengths (bluer) making it appear warmer. Inversely, a cool-white 6500 K shows a greater peak in the shorter wavelengths, and a smaller area of long-wavelength contribution making it appear to have a bluer tint. SPDs for light sources all vary. SPD curves with a similar trend that appear to be the same tint will can be classified under the same CCT, but can possess different qualities that can affect outcomes such as CS and CRI. With this being the case, it is important to use the correct SPD of sources used in a design to determine its CS contribution.

                    SPD, or spectral power distribution, graphs the amount of energy each wavelength has in a light source. Each light source is made up of a combination of wavelengths, ranging in strength, which is indicated by relative power on the y-axis. With white light being a combination of the spectral power of the many wavelengths, it is possible to have different SPDs that the brain perceives to be the same color. When the eye cannot distinguish the difference between a color that is made multiple ways, the light sources are called metamers.

                  <p>
                    All light sources have a unique SPD. for example, when typical incandescent light bulbs operate, the glow of the heated tungsten filament operates at a warmer CCT between 2600 K and 3500 K. HID lamps (high-intensity discharge) contain multiple gasses such as argon, nitrogen, xenon, and metals such as sodium and mercury. Slightly different combinations of these filaments can cause alterations to the emitted wavelengths, and concurrently its initial SPD. The filaments within fluorescents are exhausted at different rates, so over time the wavelengths the source emits change, making the lamp appear to be different colors over its lifespan. fluorescents can begin to appear to have a greener or pinker tint depending on which filaments are left to be heated. It is important to know how a lamp is going to operate throughout its lifespan and the characteristics that impact its SPD. The SPD of light sources is an important component for determining its contribution to the circadian system. With LEDs, it is possible to create any SPD curve. This can be used strategically to create light sources that impact CS levels most efficaciously.

                    The CCT can have a large impact on how the overall atmosphere of a space feels. Even if horizontal and vertical illuminance values are the same, a space can feel brighter or dingier simply if a different CCT is used. A space can give a more concentrated, alert feel if a cooler CCT is used, compared to a warmer CCT that can make a space feel more welcoming and relaxed. Both cool and warm CCTs have their advantages that depend on the space, time of day, and user preference. Note that the brightness of light and reflectance off materials in the space also contributes to the ‘feel’ of the atmosphere.

                    Based on occupant and designer preferences, and energy or horizontal illuminance concerns, a CCT can be chosen for a design. Cooler CCTs above 5000 K will provide higher CS values at lower light levels. If a dynamic CCT system is selected, multiple CCTs can be chosen.

                    Fixture type is an important decision in any design. There is a balance between aesthetically pleasing light fixtures that commonly want to provide adequate lighting for task visibility (horizontal illuminance). Another fundamental component to design for is light that stimulates the circadian system (vertical illuminance). Creating layers of light in a space would provide the most benefit for all desired components. fixtures of higher lumen output with distributions that provide the most light to the eye should be placed in locations near occupants.

                    Another option to achieve desired CS levels is to user personal light devices. Although they are not commercially available, the LRC has developed personal light apparatuses to deliver circadian effective lighting. Being close to a user, the light devices can save on energy costs because the fixtures won’t need to operate on high lumen output fixtures. More information on personal light devices can be found in the Occupant Needs section.

                    The distribution and intensity of light coming out of a fixture will determine how much light gets to the eye. A candela plot shows different cuts of a light fixture to understand how it will distribute light. Typically, a vertical cut (shown in blue) indicates the shape and intensity of light that will be distributed down into a space. The horizontal cut (shown in red) indicates the shape and intensity of light if you were looking at a light source from above.

                    Direct versus indirect lighting simply indicates which direction light fixture project light. Typical fixtures are placed in the ceiling and send light downward into the space providing ‘direct’ light, such as a troffer, downlight, and recessed linear. To reduce glare from direct view of the source, lighting fixtures can be hidden in the architecture or fixture housing. If fixtures are oriented upwards, it is considered ‘indirect’ lighting. Coves and wall valances can hide upward facing fixtures and light will bounce off the ceiling sor walls to more gently fill the space with light. Some fixtures can provide both direct (task) illumination as well as indirect (ambient) lighting. An example would be a direct/indirect linear pendant or wall mounted valance.

                    Depending on the other chosen factors, the initial lumen output necessary for a light source to have can vary. If a number of fixtures with their beam distribution are placed in locations to provide adequate light levels to the eye, less lumen output will be needed. If cooler CCTs are chosen, less light is needed at the eye to reach CS levels, therefore initial lumen output will be less for a design starting with a cooler CCT vs warmer CCT.

                    The number of fixtures in a design can be general or strategic. Typically, a general fixture layout provides a uniform distribution of light throughout an entire space. If fixtures are located in respect to occupant location, the number of fixtures could decrease. Number of fixtures is also dependent on its beam distribution, mounting height, lumen output, fixture spacing, and SPD.

                    Throughout a fixture’s lifespan, light output naturally depreciates, resulting in reduction in light contribution. Some of these light loss factors include lumen or dirt depreciation. These factors will vary per fixture, but should be taken into account so that towards the end of lamp life, light levels to reach CS are still being achieved.

                    Doing light calculations before installation is beneficial to determine the most ideal fixtures and layout to implement into a design. Many iterations and fixtures can be quickly tested to predict how light will interact in a space. Modeling your space to include furniture location and material reflectance will give a good estimate as to light levels that will be achieved at specified locations. An available software for modeling a space and calculating light is AGi. Tutorials should be done to assure proper modeling and calculating techniques.

                    The CS calculator developed by the LRC provides a way to plug in information about a light source to determine its impact on the circadian system. Once vertical illuminance values are found using AGi, and an SPD is determined, those values can be plugged into the calculator to measure CS. If multiple SPDs are used in a design, vertical illuminance contribution can be calculated separately and individually put into the calculator to see its combined measure.

                    Determining a control system for the lights is crucial for circadian design. At minimum, a lighting system should dim throughout the day to lower CS. This dimming is based on the CS schedule and can be on a time-based timing system.

                    One of the major recent advances in light and health research is the LRC&#39;s development of the Daysimeter, a research tool for measuring personal circadian light exposures and daily rest and activity levels. The Daysimeter is a one-of-a-kind practical device, as it measures circadian light based on a model of human circadian phototransduction proposed by the LRC, and is calibrated in terms of both photopic lux and circadian illuminance (a term based on the spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system.) Through use of the Daysimeter and associated software, LRC researchers are able to interpret light as a stimulus to the circadian system, quantify circadian disruption and circadian stimulus, and prescribe light treatments for adjusting circadian phase. Named one of the Top Ten Innovations of 2011, the Daysimeter and its smaller counterpart, the Daysimeter-D, are valuable tools in furthering our understanding of light&#39;s impact on human health.

                    Lighting Power Density, or LPD, refers to how much energy is being used to light a room. It is measured in watts (from the light source) per square foot (of the room), taking into account number of fixtures and CCT multiplier. LPD standards are defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). The codes are concerned with the maximum instantaneous LPD for a day. To reach the desired CS of 0.3-0.4, LPD will decrease when using CCTs that require less light output (less lumens from a fixture).

                    The energy of a system can be estimated knowing the total wattage used for a period of time. When dimming a system throughout the day for a circadian design, less wattage is being used which will save energy. Energy usage is defined in terms of kilowatt-hours (kWh).
