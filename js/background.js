Lighting design that accounts for the needs the human circadian system can potentially improve workers’ overall mood, increase alertness on the job, improve nighttime sleep, and reduce risks for chronic health problems that are associated with circadian system disruption. To achieve these goals, we recommended the adoption of lighting solutions that provide appropriate levels of circadian stimulus (CS) throughout the workday.In addition to influencing the circadian system’s timing, light can also exert an acute alerting eect on humans that is similar to that provided by a cup of coee. During the day, the biological clock sends an alerting signal to the body that counteracts and balances the body’s need for sleep, or “sleep drive,” 10 which increases the longer a person stays awake. When these two processes are synchronized, people can remain awake and alert for as long as 16 or 17 hours before the alerting signal is overtaken by sleep drive. , During sleep, both sleep drive and the alerting signal decrease before resuming their cycles in the coming day. Light’s alerting eect is the same at any time of day or night. </p><p> Exposure to high levels of blue light early in the day provides an acute alerting eect that, if delivered in the morning, will also promote circadian entrainment and better sleep. Receiving the same light later in the day and early evening, however, can desynchronize the biological clock, delay circadian phase, and interfere with getting a good night’s sleep. </p><p> Exposure to higher levels of longer wavelength (“red”) light during the “post-lunch dip” can also provide an acute alerting eect, and red light in the evening can promote alertness without suppressing melatonin production and disrupting circadian rhythms. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Occupants</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> Typical “9-5” daytime workers.

Because visual acuity is a particularly important requirement for nursing environments and strict illuminance guidelines are in place, as recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), these two factors are still crucial considerations for healthcare lighting design. Lighting design for healthcare does not begin and end with visual performance and illuminance on the work plane, however. To meet the ongoing needs of the patients in their care, hospitals must operate at all times of day, every day of the year, which puts tremendous strain on healthcare staff and, by extension, the patients and families who use their services. Healthcare support workers have the highest work absences rates of any occupation, and healthcare practitioners and technicians have the highest work absence rates of any professional occupation (according to the most recent [2016] data available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).1 While OSHA-recordable illness and injuries are declining across all U.S. industries, moreover, the rates for hospital workers have remained nearly twice as high as all private industry combined, and injuries among healthcare professionals occur at almost three times the rate of other professional and business services. </p><p> Research has shown that disruption of the circadian system stemming from rotating shift work poses numerous health risks. 3-5 While much is still unknown about the optimum lighting needs of healthcare workers, especially those who work at night, it is nonetheless possible to provide some useful guidelines based on current knowledge. The lighting specifications and techniques provided in this web resource are specifically designed to address the circadian needs of the various populations in healthcare environments, with the hope of improving health outcomes for healthcare workers, the patients they care for, and the families who visit them. It should be noted, however, that while these techniques are based on scientific findings, mostly laboratory studies, they have not been extensively tested in the field. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Occupants</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <div class="row"> <div class="col"> <h6 class="article-inner-title">Shift workers</h6> </div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col text-center"> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/1.jpg" class="d-inline-block w-22 p-1 m-2 mb-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/2.jpg" class="d-inline-block w-22 p-1 m-2 mb-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/3.jpg" class="d-inline-block w-22 p-1 m-2 mb-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/4.jpg" class="d-inline-block w-22 p-1 m-2 mb-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> </div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6"> <h6 class="article-inner-title">Day-shift workers</h6> <p> For circadian entrainment, a lighting system should deliver a CS ≥ 0.3 throughout the day, or at a minimum provide a CS ≥ 0.3 during the first 2-3 hours of the morning. For alertness at other times of day, the system can continue to deliver a CS ≥ 0.3 throughout the day or use long-wavelength (red) light as supplemental lighting during the afternoon. </p><p> The lighting patterns provided on this website present options for achieving the targeted CS ≥ 0.3: static correlated color temperature (CCT) lighting systems or tunable CCT systems. It is important to note that we have used CS as the basis for our specifications, but are reporting the specifications in CCT. Although CCT is not an adequate metric for selecting light sources to promote circadian entrainment, it is used here because it is familiar to most designers and specifiers. </p><p> For lighting systems that are limited to a single CCT, to promote alertness in the afternoon we suggest considering desktop luminaires that deliver either short wavelength (blue) or long wavelength (red) light at workers’ eye level. The advantage of desktop luminaires is that they deliver an individualized light treatment, which permits workers to personalize their lighting to suit their own needs and color preference. </p><p> It is important to remember that not all CCTs are created equal, however, and the vertical illuminance that is required to deliver the targeted CS will vary depending on which CCT is selected (see “Circadian stimulus look-up charts” here). If a cooler CCT (≥ 5000 K) is selected, for example, a lower vertical illuminance will typically be required to deliver the same CS compared to a warmer CCT (< 3500 K) source. As some SPDs can present exceptions to this rule of thumb, it is therefore important for specifiers to obtain a light source’s SPD before using the LRC’s freely available CS calculator to determine the light levels required to achieve the desired CS. </p></div><div class="col-md-6"> <h6 class="article-inner-title">Night-shift workers</h6> <p> Humans are meant to be active during the daytime and sleep at night, yet the demands of society have led to many individuals taking on night-shift work. The most recent (2004) statistics for the US labor force show that over 10 million people work full time on evening shift (typically, 3 pm to 11 pm), night shift (11 pm to 7 am), or rotating shifts (days, evenings, and nights). Shift work, especially when it involves rotating and overnight shifts, has been associated with increased risks for developing cancer and other diseases. One hypothesis postulates that exposure to light at night (LAN) suppresses melatonin, whose production is known to slow the development of cancerous cells, while another proposes that circadian disruption associated with shift work, and not just LAN, increases health risks. Further research will be required to resolve this question, but for now it is recommended that lighting design for nurses’ stations should strike a balance between the needs of the visual system and those of the circadian system, which differ between workers on day shift and night shift. </p><p> Day-shift and night-shift nursing staff have different lighting needs. During the day, lighting should be designed to promote circadian entrainment and maintain alertness. At night, the lighting demands are more complicated. While those working at night need to maintain alertness, disruption of the circadian clock (as indicated, for example, by suppression of the hormone melatonin) by exposure to light at night (LAN), especially short-wavelength (blue) light, has been associated with negative health effects. Until more research has been conducted to better understand this relationship, we recommend delivering a lighting scheme that promotes alertness without disrupting the melatonin cycle. </p></div></div><h6 class="article-inner-title mb-5 mt-4">8-hour shift workers<br/>7:00 AM - 3:00 PM, 3:00 PM - 11:00 PM, 11:00 PM - 7:00 AM</h6> <div class="row"> <div class="col"> <figure class="float-right w-65 px-3"> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/5.jpg" class="w-100 p-1 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> <figcaption class="figcaption text-center mt-3">*It is not recommended to wear orange glasses while driving</figcaption> </figure> <h6 class="article-inner-inner-title">CS schedule for hospital lighting</h6> <p> If hospitals provides overhead lighting that conforms to CS targets, the lighting schedule should accommodate all shift workers.

Nighttime lighting should be conducive to patient sleep, while also accommodating visiting families and allowing nurses to perform their tasks. </p><p> Lighting in a patient room can positively impact the recovery of a patient in psychological and physiological ways. A lighting system that can promote a proper CS schedule can aid patients to be entrained and ultimately sleep better at night. Better quality and quantity of sleep can promote better recovery. An additional benefit of having a brighter and more energizing room is the potential for patients feeling more energized and less gloomy while staying in a hospital room. </p><p> Even short-term circadian disruption leads to poor sleep, higher stress, and increased daytime sleepiness. , Circadian disruption over many years, such as that experienced by rotating shift workers whose schedules include night shifts, has been associated with health risks, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Patients in healthcare settings can also experience circadian disruption, which has been shown to have adverse effects on healing and make patients less responsive to treatment. The primary goal in lighting design for patient rooms is to promote circadian entrainment for better sleep at night. </p><p> Introducing a regular 24-hour pattern of light and dark by modulating daily exposure, delivered via electric lighting and/or daylight, can have many positive benefits. Electric lighting in senior housing facilities, for example, is typically dim and continuously operates every day and night of the week. Several field studies have shown that exposure to a robust light-dark pattern enables seniors to consolidate their sleep during the night and reduce their napping during the day. This same, simple principle of modulating the amount of electric lighting over 24 hours has been shown to be effective for improving sleep in hospital ICU patients 47and may also be effective for improving health outcomes in premature infants over 32 weeks PMA. </p><p> The causes of circadian disruption in hospitalized patients can have internal and/or external origins. Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease, for example, can lead to circadian disruption and pain, as can critical illness generally. External influences such as ambient lighting in patient rooms can also disrupt the circadian system. A study conducted in three intensive care units, for example, found that patients typically sleep for only about 6 hours over a given 24-hour period, with only about half of their sleep time occurring at night. Improving and increasing sleep during the night by promoting entrainment of a patient’s circadian rhythm to a regular light–dark cycle may lead to improved health outcomes. </p><figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/20.jpg" class="float-right w-35 p-1 m-2 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> The recommended lighting pattern for patients over the course of a 12-hour day begins with a CS of 0.3 in the morning for at least 3 hours, drops to a CS of 0.2 for the mid-afternoon, and then drops once again to a CS of 0.1 in the late afternoon through the evening until bedtime. After bedtime, lights should be turned off in the room and nightlights should be added to allow for safe navigation. This pattern can be accomplished using lighting designs that employ either static or tunable CCT systems. It is important to note that we have used CS as the basis for our specifications, but are reporting the specifications in CCT. Although CCT is not an adequate metric for selecting light sources to promote circadian entrainment, it is used here because it is familiar to most designers and specifiers. </p><p> A static lighting system with a single CCT of 4000 K, for example, would require an average illuminance of 400 lux at the patient’s eye to achieve a CS of 0.3. Employing a color tunable system, on the other hand, affords specifiers and designers with far more flexibility. A 5000 K light source providing 300 lux at the eye will deliver a CS of 0.3, whereas a shorter wavelength (e.g., 460 nm) light source would require an average illuminance of only 50 lux to achieve a CS of 0.4. </p></div></div><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Infants</h6> <div class="row"> <div class="col"> <div class="text-center"> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/21.jpg" class="d-inline-block w-22 p-1 m-2 mb-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/22.jpg" class="d-inline-block w-22 p-1 m-2 mb-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/23.jpg" class="d-inline-block w-22 p-1 m-2 mb-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> <img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/24.jpg" class="d-inline-block w-22 p-1 m-2 mb-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/> </div><p> Research has shown that implementing a cyclical, 24-hour cycled lighting schedule results in positive outcomes for infants of 32 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) and older. These schedules have been associated with improved sleep after discharge, advanced oral feeding readiness, faster weight gain, reduced time using a ventilator, and enhanced motor coordination compared to infants who have been exposed to continuously lit, bright or dim environments. </p><p> It is hypothesized that these positive outcomes are related to fetal circadian rhythms that become established by the third trimester of pregnancy, which are imposed exogenously on the infant by the mother through melatonin secretion (via the placenta), her rest–activity patterns, and changes in her core body temperature. Cycled lighting has also been demonstrated to improve activity–rest behaviors among premature infants of 32 weeks PMA, helping them to be more active in the day than at night sooner than infants of the same age who were exposed to continuous dim lighting. Infants exposed to cycled lighting have shown this entrained activity–rest pattern within the first 10 days at home after discharge, whereas it has not been observed among the dim-lighting condition infants until 21-30 days after discharge. </p><p> As there is no verifiable benefit to infants younger than 32 weeks PMA receiving a cycled lighting schedule, however, it is recommended that lighting for circadian entrainment not be introduced until that age is reached. While the research to date has not validated a link between bright light exposures and retinopathy of prematurity, a disease which causes permanent retinal damage and scarring, as a precautionary measure it is recommended that infants eyes be protected from direct views of electric lighting and sunlight at any time while in the NICU. </p><p> It is pretty common to hear that a newborn doesn’t sleep through the night. Have you ever wondered why? Babies first develop in the womb and are in sync with the mother’s body. They are not exposed to their own external cues to entrain their biological clock, therefore, they are born without sleep/wake cycles. Their birth is the time where zeitgebers are most important. When in the hospital or at home, babies should be exposed to light/dark cycles to entrain them more quickly to the solar day. When getting up with a baby at night, turning on bright overhead lights should be avoided, especially for long periods of time. Dimmed overhead lights or nightlights should be used when a baby needs care during the night. Otherwise, the baby will not be able to distinguish between day and night. Another cue for circadian entrainment comes from breast milk. If a mother is in sync with the solar day, her breast milk will contain hormones, and most importantly, melatonin at night. With this being the case, pre-pumped bottles should be time stamped and given at the correct time of day to assure that doses of melatonin are not given in the morning, as this would disrupt and confuse the baby’s developing circadian rhythms. </p><figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/25.jpg" class="float-right w-35 p-1 m-2 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> The recommended lighting pattern for infants (no younger than 32 weeks PMA) over the course of a 24-hour day begins with a CS of 0.3 in the morning for at least 2 hours, and then drops to a CS of 0.1 for the rest of the day. At night, darkness is recommended. This can be accomplished using different lighting designs employing either static or tunable CCT systems.

A 5000 K light source providing 300 lux at the eye level (not direct light) will deliver a CS of 0.3, whereas a shorter wavelength (e.g., 460 nm) light source would require an average illuminance of only 50 lux to achieve a CS of 0.4 and thereby prevent potentially harmful retinal exposures. </p></div></div></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Specialty information</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Lighting in the NICU</h6> <h6 class="article-inner-inner-title">Circadian entrainment:</h6> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/26.png" class="float-right w-65 p-4 m-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, or NICU, is where care for ill or premature babies occurs. Lighting for the NICU must address three distinct populations: newborns, healthcare staff, and the newborns’ visiting families. The needs of the infant patients, of course, are the highest priority, but anyone who works in or visits the space requires a lighting system that supports their health and well-being. Since a typical NICU operates 24-7, its lighting design needs to address the visual performance requirements of health care workers at all times of day and night while also attending to the health and well-being of all individuals. Once infants reach 32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), they can benefit from receiving at least 2 hours of high circadian stimulus (CS) in the morning to promote circadian entrainment to the solar day. Balancing these different needs requires zones of light for each population to provide the proper amount, spectra and durations of light exposure at the appropriate time of day or night. The lighting patterns presented in the application portion are designed to promote circadian health using circadian stimulus (CS) as the primary design component. Developed by the LRC, the CS metric can be used to predict the percentage of melatonin suppression over a 1-hour light exposure as a means to quantify circadian stimulation. For the NICU, it is recommended that illuminance be measured both for the infants in incubators and the caregivers in their workspaces (see diagrams) These illuminance values are used to calculate CS. Note that no direct view of any light should reach the infants’ eyes. </p><h6 class="article-inner-inner-title">Visual performance:</h6> <p> Ambient lighting for infant care areas should be adjustable and within a range of 10-600 lux on task surfaces. To avoid discomfort, the infants should be protected from direct views of any electric lighting or sunlight. Indirect electric lighting and daylight are recommended, however, and at least one source of daylight in or adjacent to the space is probably beneficial for the patients, families, and staff. But provision should be made to control daylight so that visual and thermal discomfort can be avoided. All windows should be treated with blinds and curtains to ensure that sunlight in the space does not become a nuisance. </p><p> During the performance of medical procedures, examination lighting should be positioned in a way that permits staff to work at an individual station and provides at least 2000 lux on the infant, while taking care to avoid ‘spill light’ into the eyes of the patient or other nearby infants. 40Using examination lighting with adjustable, directional output is encouraged to ensure that these standards are met. The IES recommends the following average horizontal illuminance levels for the task plane (i.e., 2’-6” above finished floor [AFF]) in the NICU. </p><figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/27.png" class="float-right w-40 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Infant areas (Zone 1): Two horizontal illuminance levels are recommended, depending on caregiver activity. A light level of 300 lux is recommended during normal observation, and 500 lux is recommended during examination periods. </p><p> Nurses’ station (Zone 2): Two horizontal illuminance levels are recommended for either day shift or night shift. A light level of 500 lux is recommended during the day shift, and a level of 300 lux is recommended during the night shift. </p><p> General circulation areas in the NICU (Zone 3): Two horizontal illuminance levels are recommended, depending on the time of day. A light level of 400 lux is recommended during the day shift, and level of 100 lux is recommended during the night shift. Note: All listed illuminance recommendations are based on users between the ages of 25 and 65. </p><p> The varied intricacy and difficulty of visual tasks performed in the NICU also call for varying lighting specifications. Generally, the higher the light level, the faster the visual system can convert optical stimuli into usable information. For tasks involving objects that are very small or have low contrast with their environment, high light levels (> 1000 lux) are required. For tasks involving larger objects or those that have suitable contrast with the environment, where increased light levels provide diminishing returns, low-level ambient lighting (100-200 lux) is acceptable. </p><p> Glare caused by electric lighting, sunlight, reflective surfaces, and other sources can be avoided by selecting the appropriate luminaires and making interior design changes within the space. Indirect light sources can be used to avoid glare while still meeting visual and circadian requirements, and other sources of glare can be reduced or eliminated by selecting non-reflective finishes for surfaces, altering window locations or incubator positions, if possible, and using window blinds. </p><p> Finally, color rendering is another important consideration for luminaire selection, as accurate color perception is crucial for health care staff to make proper medical diagnosis of newborns. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Patient orientation in bed</h6> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/28.png" class="float-right w-40 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Hospital beds have the ability to angle patients to be in an upright position as well as laying down. Lighting should accommodate for both of these orientations that a patient could be in. Circadian stimulus getting to the eye as well as glare factors would change based on the orientation of a patient. If laying down, light directly above could be glary if it is in direct view of a patient’s line of sight. The use of indirect lighting fixtures. </p><p> The lighting patterns presented in the application portion are designed to promote circadian health using circadian stimulus (CS) as the primary design component. Developed by the LRC, the CS metric can be used to predict the percentage of melatonin suppression over a 1-hour light exposure as a means to quantify circadian stimulation. For patient rooms, it is recommended that illuminance be measured at the patients’ eye in two ways: (1) while sitting up at a 45 degree tilt and (2) while laying down looking straight up at the ceiling (see diagrams below). These illuminance values are used to calculate CS. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Visual performance in patient rooms</h6> <p> Similar to the NICU, patient rooms also need to accommodate a wide range of end users, including patients, caregivers, and visiting families. Lighting design should strike a balance between proper circadian entrainment for the patients, while providing caregivers sufficient lighting to perform exams. </p><p> Hospitalized patients spend a majority of their time in bed. As hospital beds can be tilted in a variety of positions, luminaires should be placed to avoid direct views by patients. Lighting should also be configured and positioned to avoid shadows and veiling reflections (i.e., reflected glare) on televisions and other electronic devices. The use of task lighting would be beneficial for visiting family members, should the patient prefer to sleep while the family members remain awake. Illumination from task lighting should be limited to the family’s seating area so it does not disturb the patient. </p><p> Providing access to bedside lighting controls allows patients to adjust the lighting to personally desired levels, thereby affording them greater comfort and a certain degree of independence. Creating a comfortable and relaxing environment with lighting is important in order to encourage the well-being of patients and their families. Access to daylight has also been associated with improved patient health outcomes and shorter hospital stays, and could potentially provide bedridden patients with visual cues for the time of day and circadian entrainment. As daylight can cause problems with glare and thermal discomfort at certain times of day, however, it would also be beneficial to provide patients with access to bedside window shade controls. </p><p> Nighttime lighting is also an important design consideration. Being in an unfamiliar place can be disorienting, even for healthy people, especially at night. Incorporating dim night lighting that is triggered when the patient gets up to use the bathroom, for example, can reduce the risk of falls in patient rooms. Studies have shown that providing enhanced horizontal and vertical lighting, compared to conventional wall plug night lights, improves balance in older adults when transitioning from a sitting to a standing position. For patient rooms, such directional lighting could be installed under beds to provide horizontal lighting cues to assist patients with nighttime navigation. The IES recommends horizontal illuminance levels on the floor of 2 lux for night lights. Using a warmer CCT, such as 2200 K or 2700 K, would also provide proper visibility without disrupting the circadian system at night. This lighting system can be controlled by a photosensor so that dim light is available throughout the night. </p><figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/healthcare/29.png" class="float-right w-40 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> The IES recommends the following average horizontal illuminance levels for patient rooms. </p><p> Patient Area (Zone 1): Two horizontal illuminance levels are recommended for Zone 1, depending on patient or caregiver activity. For reading, a light level of 400 lux is recommended at the head of the bed at a typical reading position. For exams, a light level of 500 lux is recommended for the caregivers at 3’-0” AFF. </p><p> Family Area (Zone 2): The single horizontal illuminance level recommended for Zone 1 is 150 lux at workplane, or 2’-6” AFF. </p><p> General Area (Zone 3): The single horizontal illuminance level recommended for Zone 1 is 100 lux AFF. </p><p> Note: All listed illuminance recommendations are based on users between the ages of 25 and 65. </p><p> The varied intricacy and difficulty of visual tasks performed in patient rooms also call for varying lighting specifications.

An inevitable change includes the thickening of the crystalline lens, which causes an increase in absorption of light before it gets to the retina (and ultimately into the brain). Scattering of light within these layers increases sensitivity to glare. This also causes less color discrimination in shorter wavelengths causing older adults to perceive the world to have more of a yellow tint than what younger adults perceive. As the eye ages, it also loses ability to suppress transmission of rod signals to the brain. Rod photoreceptors in the eye are responsible for night vision because they are activated in dim lighting conditions (< 0.001 lux)[6]. With that being the case, the aging eye lessens its capacity to stop the transmission of those signals to the brain, contributing to the increased sensitivity to light. When creating a senior care lighting system, lighting should be designed to positively impact the aging visual, circadian and perceptual systems. The overall goal in designing for older adults is to create an environment with high enough ambient and task lighting, while avoiding direct glare in the eyes from luminaires. </p><p> For older adults in long-term care facilities, the designer should consider using the 24-hour lighting scheme in common areas where residents are more likely to spend their waking hours. This may vary with the application. For example, in a single-room assisted living setting, the dual lighting scheme needs to be implemented in the room and in a common area, such as the dining room. In nursing homes, the dual lighting scheme can be implemented in day rooms and dining rooms. If power density requirements are still an issue, however, local supplementary lights from blue LEDs can be integrated into the design. Compliance to light treatment via supplementary lighting system may be an issue. In cases where compliance is not an issue, such as when the treatment is applied to healthy older adults living at home, ambient light levels can be reduced to 80-100 lux at the cornea (which is about 200-300 lux on the horizontal surfaces) of a neutral light source (3000-4100 K lamp) and the use of supplemental task light delivering 30 lux at the cornea of a blue light (λmax=470 nm) from LEDs can be used for at least 2 hours in the morning. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Occupants</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> On average, older adults are not being exposed to a robust light/dark pattern in their daily lives to accommodate the needs of the aging eye. Since light/dark patterns are not robust, rest/activity patterns will not be either. Especially when older adults spend the majority of the day inside, circadian entrainment is non-existent and naps during the day and the inability to sleep through the night is common. As well, the aging population has been shown to have a decrease in melatonin concentration, which also contributes to the body’s disorientation when it comes to proper sleep time . Enforcing a robust light/dark schedule, and assurance that enough light will reach the back of the eye is the challenge. Targeting a higher CS of 0.4 during the day, assuming losses from absorbed or scattered light through the lens, and will better account for getting enough light through to reach a CS of at least 0.3. However, with higher light levels comes higher chance for glare perception, especially in older adults with higher sensitivity to discomfort from glare. When designing lighting for older adults, it is imperative to provide a lighting system with optics that allow for proper light levels to reach the eye while avoiding harsh glare caused by (especially if horizontal illuminance levels get too high). To reduce high discomfort from glare, choose lighting fixtures with a distribution that gives a vertical to horizontal illuminance ratio closer to 1 (illuminance that reaches the eye is a similar value to illuminance on the work plane). </p><div class="row"> <div class="col"> <div class="w-75 m-auto"> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/1.jpg" class="w-100 p-1 m-2 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <figcaption class="figcaption ml-3 mt-3 mb-4">Choose to target 0.3 if:<br/>- Furniture layout is defined and unchanging<br/>- Energy usage is a major concern</figcaption> </div></div><div class="col"> <div class="w-75 m-auto"> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/2.jpg" class="w-100 p-1 m-2 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <figcaption class="figcaption ml-3 mt-3 mb-4">Choose to target 0.4 if:<br/>- Warmer CCTs can make a space feel more home-like and will require higher light levels to acieve 0.4 CS. This will increase light levels on the workplane for task visibility which is beneficial for the aging eye</figcaption> </div></div></div><p> The light levels recommended for the circadian system should be sufficient for older adults to perform daily visual tasks. In spaces where high circadian stimulation cannot be used, ambient light levels for the aging visual system should be 200-300 lux on the horizontal surfaces (80-100 lux at the cornea) of a neutral light source (i.e., 3000-4100 K lamp). More localized light will be needed to perform tasks that require seeing fine details (e.g., reading prescription bottle labels, chopping vegetables). Architects and specifiers should still provide lighting that gives high, glare-free illumination on the task with no direct or reflected view of the light source, soft shadows throughout the space, balanced illuminance levels, and light sources that provide good color rendering. </p><p> Some other lighting principles for the aging visual system that can help architects, specifiers, builders, facility managers, and homeowners light interior spaces include: </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">More light on task areas</h6> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/3.jpg" class="float-right w-40 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Use concentrated light to increase illuminance levels on the task. As much as 10 times more light will be required to see fine details (e.g., reading text with a small font size) or low-contrast objects (e.g., black thread on blue cloth) than is required to see most architectural structures (e.g., doors, cabinets, furniture). Increase light level in areas where visual tasks are performed by placing adjustable light fixtures close to the task, or by selecting lamps with more lumens (look for lumen rating on the package, not wattage; be careful not to exceed the lamp fixture wattage). Increase ambient light levels by keeping surface finishes light in color. Light-colored walls, floors, and ceilings will help minimize shadows and increase overall light levels in the living environment. Place light fixtures where visibility is important, such as below the kitchen countertop, over the kitchen sink, in the shower, and in closet and laundry spaces. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Less glare</h6> <p> Although older adults require more light to see, care should be taken to avoid glare. Glare is experienced when light sources or bright reflections in the field of view impair vision, or are uncomfortable. Very bright lights should not be placed against dark ceilings. The light source itself should be hidden with a shade, baffles, non-shiny louvers, or a shielding board. If a bare lamp is unavoidable (e.g., fan lights), it should be frosted to diffuse the light. In this same vein, clear glass light fixtures should also be avoided. The use of shiny floor finishes and polished surfaces should also be minimized to reduce reflection from light sources. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Balanced light levels</h6> <p> Due to optical and perhaps neural changes in the eye, older adults cannot adapt to dim lighting conditions as well as younger people. As a result, illuminance levels in transitional spaces, such as hallways and entrance foyers, should be similar to those of the adjacent spaces. The ambient light levels in adjacent spaces should be balanced to be approximately the same. Multiple switches or dimmers to create intermediate light levels in transitional spaces that lead from bright, outdoor areas, to dim, indoor spaces should be chosen. Transitional spaces should be dimmer at night and brighter during the day. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Enhanced colors</h6> <p> Color discrimination is poorer for older adults because of scattered light in the eye. The aged lens also absorbs relatively more short wavelength (blue) light, so it is particularly difficult to discriminate between, for example, dark purple and maroon. Use lamps with high lumens and good color rendering properties (CRI > 80). </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Improved contrast</h6> <p> Because contrast sensitivity is reduced with age, the visibility of important objects, such as stair edges, curbs, ramps, or doorways, can be greatly improved by increasing their contrast with paint or similar techniques. Contrasting colors to mark edges, such as doorframes, baseboards, or steps should be used. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Muted patterns</h6> <p> Avoid busy patterns on walls, floors, and furniture. Busy patterns can cause visual confusion and disorientation, especially to residents with eye diseases and/or Alzheimer’s. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Home-like feel</h6> <p> To make residents feel more at home with a warm atmosphere, while achieving higher light levels for circadian entrainment and stimulation, warmer furniture, flooring, and walls can be strategically used. Using warmer tones of wood or carpet flooring as well as a beige walls could make a space feel warmer even when using cooler CCTs, compared to using stark white walls and floors. The presence of a fireplace can also provide a more welcoming atmosphere. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Outside accessibility</h6> <p> Accessibility and encouragement to visit outdoor patios will provide fresh air and light stimulus from daylight. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Speciality information</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Alzheimer’s disease</h6> <p> Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes a slow deterioration of the neurons in the brain which results in memory loss, lessened cognitive functioning, and eventual decline in the ability to do daily tasks. Basically, the neurons communicating in the brain that are responsible for making connections for memory, thinking, or task-doing do not send strong enough signals for the actions to be completed. Contrary to misconceived notions, memories are not entirely lost, initially, they are just unable to be retrieved due to a poor connection. However, the brain is a muscle similar to the others in the body; if it is not strengthened, it will become weaker and weaker until it reaches its terminus. Strengthening of brain activity can be enhanced with stimulation from light through the eye. If stimulus is provided, potential enhancement of memory and activity have been shown to occur. Studies have shown the successful effect of using high light levels through the eye to stimulate the firing of neurons in individuals in the early onset of AD. </p><p> With the aging eye being one factor for less light reaching the back of the eye, as a person ages, it is more likely for them to stay inside and not being exposed to a robust light/dark schedule. This, consequently, leads to circadian disruption and poor sleep quality. This disruption can cause constant tiredness and can have an effect on mood and behavior. </p><p> Along with these, consistent circadian disruption can lead to the onset of complications associated with AD. Whether a preventative measure, or delaying the onset of diagnosed AD, a proper circadian lighting schedule that ensures higher light levels reaching the back of the eye are important for the aging population. For individuals with AD, a high CS value of 0.3-0.4 is suggested for the duration of daytime hours, only lower to 0.2 after 5 PM. This will ensure stimulation not only for the circadian system, but for cognitive functioning as well. This light can be delivered using light tables, which has been shown by Figueiro MG, et al to improve sleep, depression, and agitation in patients with AD. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Eye diseases</h6> <p> Optical (pre-retinal) and neural (age related) eye diseases are the most common reason for impaired visibility. The prevailing causes are presbyopia and cataracts (optical), and glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy (neural). Lighting design tactics can be used strategically to provide the most comfort and visibility. The chart below gives a quick overview of design tactics that could be implemented. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Cataratcts - The overall blurring and yellowing of lens</h6> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/4.png" class="float-right w-50 mx-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Complication- With the accumulation of exposure to UV radiation during a lifetime, a yellow film is attained in the lenses of the eyes. Light is absorbed and scattered resulting in clouded vision and glare. A consequence of this is the decline of being able to discriminate colors, as well as reduced visual acuity within the entire field of vision. </p><p> Lighting application- A cooler CCT could be used to combat the perception of yellowing due to the yellow filter from the lens. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Presbyopia - The aging of the eye</h6> <p> Complication: Presbyopia is a pre-retinal complication that is simply the natural aging of the lens. The ability to focus at different distances is lost, which is why reading glasses are needed. To combat this loss, at least 500 lux on task surfaces should be reached (according to the ANSI/IES RP-28-16 recommendations). </p><p> Lighting application: Color contrast of materials within spaces should also be implemented to create discrimination between thresholds and changes within the space. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Pupillary miosis - Reduction in pupil size</h6> <p> Complication: Pupillary miosis is the reduction of average pupil size which becomes less responsive to changing light levels. Since the pupil controls how much light is let into the eye, this causes less light overall to get in the eye. If less light is actually getting in the eye, many things are compromised including circadian stimulation from light. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Glaucoma - Loss in peripheral vision</h6> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/5.png" class="float-right w-22 mx-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Complication: This neural disease causes an increased fluid pressure inside the eyeball, which causes vision loss especially in the peripheral vision. This becomes a problem, especially with being able to detect surroundings (e.g. when driving). The ability to see in dark atmospheres is also compromised due to less rod contribution to vision. Contrast sensitivity declines as well, which results in the inability to distinguish between colors and spaces that are close in color or gradient. Ability to adapt to changing light levels is reduced also. </p><p> Lighting application: Since the disease destroys the photoreceptors, light cannot bring them back, but rather can enhance the activation of the remaining photoreceptors. Overall ambient light levels are important to keep high, as well as light cues at night when an older adult is navigating the space to the bathroom. Discrimination around thresholds is helpful too. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Macular Degeneration - Loss in central vision</h6> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/6.png" class="float-right w-50 mx-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Complication: This neural disease affects sharp central vision, which is what is used to see fine detail. For this reason, peripheral vision is more relied on. Since short wavelength cones are only present outside the fovea, sensitivity is potentially greater (*fact check*). The use of a cooler CCT may benefit an individual with this complication. </p><p> Lighting application: Need a lot of light to see </p><h6 class="article-inner-title-not-centered my-5">Diabetic Retinopathy - Random blocking of vision</h6> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/7.png" class="float-right w-50 mx-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Complication: This neural disease is caused by diabetes creating complications in the retina by damaging blood vessels due to deprivation of oxygen and nutrients which in turn causes them to leak. Hemorrhages are then formed by the ruptured blood vessels, and black spots appear sporadically over the field of vision. </p><p> Lighting application: Since vision is sporadically blocked, light levels should be sufficient for task as well as navigation. </p><h6 class="article-inner-title my-5">Reduce falls</h6> <figure><img src="img/background/occupant needs/senior care/8.png" class="float-right w-30 mx-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> In addition to impacting our circadian system, light reveals the many intersecting spatial planes that make up the environment. Architectural features can be used to provide information about the environment and therefore improve navigation in the space. Light reveals visual information by providing a spatial reference for self-position and location of obstacles within a person’s surroundings. For example, removal of visual cues by closing the eyes has been shown to result in increased body sway. , Therefore, lighting schemes that reveal or enhance architectural features should be used to aid navigation and orientation in the built environment. </p><p> Nightlights that both reduce the risk of falls and help to maintain sleep should be used. The nightlights should provide dim illumination to the local environment (1 to 3 lux at the cornea), but also provide enhanced spatial perceptual information about the surroundings. Nightlights accent the rectilinear architectural features in the room, highlighting essential vertical and horizontal information people need to promote postural stability while navigating in an otherwise dim environment. Since the nightlights are only on when motion is detected, they do not require the occupant to search blindly for a light switch that, when found, would then activate a bright, ambient lighting system. They are on only when a person needs to move through the space at night. </p></div></div></div></article>');
