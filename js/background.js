For humans, light reaching the back of our eyes is the main stimulus that synchronizes the biological clock and thus our body’s circadian rhythms to the solar day, telling our bodies to do the right thing at the right time. Sleeping and waking, feeding and fasting, the regulation of body temperature and blood pressure, and the secretion of hormones are just a few examples of circadian rhythms. </p><p> But what light gives, light can take away. Exposure to light at the wrong times, which has become increasingly common since the advent of electrical lighting over a century ago, can desynchronize our circadian rhythms. Exposure to light at night (LAN), for example, is now a fact of life in out 24-hour society, and has been linked with poor sleep and health problems including certain types of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. </p><p> Adversely, not getting enough light throughout the day will cause the biological system (naturally cycling on an average of 24.2 hours) to not synchronize with the 24-hour solar day, making it lag behind. Without social commitments demanding us to sleep and wake up at certain times, the circadian system would become completely out of sync with the solar day. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12"> <div class="card background-card drop-shadow"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title">Bad Lighting Example</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 ml-2 text-muted">- Constant CCT (white light) <br/>- Constant light levels (dim) <br/>- CS < 0.1</h6> <video id="badAnimation" class="w-100" loop muted> <source src="img/background/background/lighting and the circadian system/BAD H265 FINAL.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <source src="img/background/background/lighting and the circadian system/BAD H264 FINAL.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <h5>Biological System</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-4 ml-2 text-muted">- Free running on averge of 24.2 hour <br/>- Out of sync with the 24 hour solar day<br/><small class="ml-2">(graphic exaggerated for effect)</small></h6> <h5>Outcomes</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-4 ml-2 text-muted">Social Jet Lag:<br/> Body functions will be out of sync with desired sleep and wake cycles.

To keep ourselves awake during the day, the body overcomes sleep pressure with alerting signals that are regulated by the circadian system. At a certain time of day, the magnitude of the alerting signal is not high enough to combat sleep pressure, and what is known as a ‘post-lunch dip’ occurs. A post-lunch dip occurs between 2-4pm, or 16-18 hours after a person went to bed the night before. This is why people can feel tired and unproductive around this time of day. To compensate for this, the LRC has shown the impact of using red light to have an alerting effect, without disruption of the circadian system. Using a personal light device contributing 50 lux of monochromatic red light at the eye has been shown to increase alertness. Similar to a cup of coffee, light can have acute alerting effects. <figure class="text-center"><img src="img/background/background/sleep pressure and daily alertness/2.png" class="w-25 rounded p-4 m-4" alt=""/></figure> </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <p> Hormones are the signals sent as messages from the brain and into the body. Melatonin and cortisol are inverse hormones released at specific times of the day. Melatonin is released at night as an ‘activity to non-activity’ signal to get the body to wind down and sleep. Cortisol is the signal in the morning to get the body ready for the change from non-activity to activity, and begins to alert the body to wake up. Both are anticipatory hormones, meaning their signals are sent out in anticipation of sleep or wake time. Just like it is natural for the body to take between 10-20 minutes to fall asleep, the body should know to slowly wake itself up, rather than abruptly waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle. For example, if a person has a rhythmic sleep/wake pattern and their natural wakeup time is 8 AM, cortisol will begin to be released at 6 AM, slowly waking the body up from its last REM cycle. A sharp peak of cortisol occurs 30-40 minutes after waking up. This is known as Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and is important to prepare the body for the upcoming day. If a person is sleep deprived, CAR is reduced, making it even harder for a person to feel awake in the morning and ready to start the day. In the morning, 800 lux of white light at the eye can increase cortisol levels. </p><p> Melatonin and cortisol secretion from the brain is controlled by the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) which has a direct connection to the optic nerve, and input from the eye. This means that the input from light through the eye plays a large role in how the body’s circadian system communicates to the rest of the body. </p></div></div></div></article> <article id="section-structureOfTheEye"> <div class="sticky-title text-center"> <h2>Structure of the Eye</h2> </div><div class="container-fluid mt-4 pr-4"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <figure class="m-4"><img src="img/background/background/structure of the eye/1.png" class="float-right w-65 rounded m-4 p-4 drop-shadow" alt=""/></figure> <p> The eye is a complex structure that is a visual relay system, taking messages from light energy, interpreting it, and sending signals to the brain for perceiving. Light first enters through the cornea where 2/3 of the bending of light happens at this air-to-cornea threshold. The eye is sensitive to the brightness of light, and the pupil changes in size to accommodate for the dynamic changes in light level throughout the day. The pupil will become a larger aperture in darker environments to let in more light in order to see better. Oppositely, in bright environments, such as a sunny day, the pupil decreases in size to reduce the discomfort from bright and glary sources. This expansion and contraction is controlled by the ciliary muscle. </p><p> When light enters through the lens, since the lens is a convex shape, it will bend the light and direct it to the macula where it is focused. The fovea is responsible for central vision, where we can detect fine detail and colors. It makes up 2 degrees of the whole retina, yet we rely on it heavily for discrimination of detail. The retina contains photoreceptors that are sensitive to wavelengths in the visible spectrum (approximately 380-780 nm). The way light within this spectrum interacts and bounces off surfaces and into the eye is what allows us to see. The tissues in retina are an extension of the brain, so it plays an important role in relaying information from the environment to the brain to perceive. Information that the photoreceptors in the retina perceive send signals through the optic nerve and into the brain. Since there is a break in the retina where the optic nerve is located, the optic disc creates a blind spot. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <p> Hormones are the signals sent as messages from the brain and into the body.

In other words, they speak the same language, and the mechanisms in the eye translate these signals for the brain to interpret. </p><p> For colors to be visible, a mechanism that can interpret the wavelengths must be in place. That is where the photoreceptors in the eye come into play. The eye is made up of photoreceptors in the fovea (central vision) and the surrounding retina (peripheral vision). The human eye has an inverted retina, meaning light goes past all the layers to the pigment epithelium layer which is located in the back of the retina. Here, it gets absorbed and sent back through the layers and exits through the optic nerve. Within the retina, color is distinguished by the cone photoreceptors. The eye contains three cone photoreceptors: long-, medium-, and short-wavelength cones. Each have a range of wavelengths they are sensitive to, and have a peak wavelength sensitivity. Long-wavelength cones have a peak sensitivity at 564 nm, medium-wavelength cones at 533 nm, and short-wavelength cones at 437 nm. As seen in the figure below, each photoreceptor has a range of wavelengths that they are sensitive to and will activate a response. The y-axis on the graph associates with how much absorption of light each photoreceptor is capable of at each wavelength. </p><figure><img src="img/background/background/structure of the retina/2.png" class="float-right w-35 p-4 m-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Knowing these wavelengths associate to perceived color in the visible spectrum, the combination of signals all the cones receive go through the Bipolar “connector” cell layer that takes combined signals from different photoreceptors throughout the retina. The Ganglion layer then communicates with multiple bipolar layers to determine what electrical signal it wants to send to the brain. An oversimplification, but the takeaway is that the messages sent to the brain go through multiple layers of communication with one another, getting feedback and deciding on what message it will send to the brain. The brain then interprets this signal to determine what colors and image it sees. The figure depicts the connections of the components in the retina and the process light undergoes when traveling through the retina. </p></div></div></div></article> <article id="section-rodsAndCones"> <div class="sticky-title text-center"> <h2>Rods and Cones</h2> </div><div class="container-fluid mt-4 pr-4"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 right-border-large"> <p> In addition to cones, another photoreceptor in the retina are rods that are activated in dim light conditions (< ___ lux).

This also explains that when your vision adapts to the dark when you’re outside at night, you can’t see color because cones don’t activate at such low light levels. The figure below shows a graph of the amount and distribution of rods and cones in the retina, with the center of the fovea being 0 degrees. </p><figure class="text-center"><img src="img/background/background/rods and cones/2.png" class="w-90 m-4 p-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> </div></div></div></article> <article id="section-ipGRC"> <div class="sticky-title text-center"> <h2>ipGRC</h2> </div><div class="container-fluid mt-4 pr-4"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <figure class="text-center"><img src="img/background/background/ipgrcs/1.png" class="float-right w-50 m-4 p-2 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> In addition to rods and cones, the retina contains a recently discovered third type of photoreceptor whose focus is not visual perception, but is rather concerned with the circadian system. ipRGCs, or intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are not located in the photoreceptor layer with the rods and cones. They are located in the layer right before the optic nerve and have a 1:1 connection to the brain, which is different than the L, M, and S cones. That means the signal the ipRGC gets goes directly to the part of the brain that is responsible for circadian entrainment. These photoreceptors also connect back to other layers and receive input from the other photoreceptors. ipRGCs have a peak spectral sensitivity of 484 nm within the short-wavelength range, which is why the circadian system is more sensitive to shorter (blue) wavelengths and considered a “blue sky detector.” Light sources that contain higher concentration of shorter wavelengths, and less in the longer wavelengths in their SPD will have a larger impact on circadian entrainment. </p><p> Knowing this information, we can begin learning about how to do circadian lighting designs. </p></div></div></div></article>');

The evidence suggests that high circadi-an stimulation during daytime waking hours can probably be achieved by receiving about 400 lux at the cornea of a 6500 K (cool-white) light source. Relatively dim ambient evening light (less than 30 lux at the eye) can be provided by light sources such as a 2700 K (warm-white) light source. </p><figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/what is circadian lighting/2.png" class="float-left w-35 p-4 m-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Throughout a day, daylight is dynamic in its associated CCT (correlated color temperature) along with intensity (bright-ness). Its robust routine starts with a sunrise around 2000 K, and early morning sun around 3500 K. Late morning and aernoon daylight reaches 6000 K, and on a blue-sky day, 10000 K. The ladder down for the remainder of the day is mirrored, ending with dark skies, indicating that it is time for sleep. Being able to simulate the spectral qualities of sun-light and intensity throughout the day would provide the maximum eiciency for circadian rhythms. However, interior spaces don’t always have windows that can provide an entire space with the desired eect of sunlight, and light schedules are typically dominated by electric lighting. The most eective and eicacious electric lighting schedule would provide dynamic CCT and intensity throughout a day, with fixture spacing and distribution eicient for delivering the light to the eye. </p><p> If a dynamic CCT system is not available, a CS schedule can still be achieved using a single CCT that is dimmed for enhancement of a robust light/dark schedule. Since cooler CCTs (6500 K or 5000 K) have higher peaks in the ‘blue’ wavelengths (450-485 nm), these CCTs will have a larger impact on the CS scale and achieve 0.3-0.4 CS at lower light levels when compared to a warmer CCT, due to the peak spectral sensitivity of the circadian system being 460 nm. Since cooler CCTs such as 6500 K have more area or ‘power’ in the SPD curve under the shorter wavelengths (when compared to 2700 K), it will have a stronger eect on the on the biological clock. If overhead lighting alone is unable to provide suicient light levels to the eye to reach high CS levels, personal light devices are a great alternative. These devices can be placed on a desk or work area in front of an individual and provide extra light stimulus. In the morning hours, the light device can provide 30 lux of monochromatic blue light at the eye. </p><figure class="text-center"><img src="img/background/circadian design/what is circadian lighting/3.png" class="w-75 p-4 m-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> High circadian stimulation during the day and low circadian stimulation during the evening can be achieved using a combination of daylight and electric light sources. Daylight can certainly be an eective light source for regulating the circadian system. Outdoor lighting has the ideal quantity, spectrum, distribution, timing, and duration, but it should not be assumed that daylight in buildings will always provide people with a suitable circadian light pattern. Again, a quantitative analysis of daylight in the space should be carefully made because the amount of daylight varies considerably throughout a building. Daylight levels in a room drop very quickly as the distance from the window increases; daylight levels are quite low 3-4 meters away from a window, even on a sunny day. It should also be noted that if sunlight from the window penetrates the room, discomfort glare may cause occupants to draw blinds or shades, eliminating daylight entirely from the space. Since it cannot be assumed that daylight in buildings is always going to be a solution for circadian entrainment, electric light must always be considered. </p><p> The relatively dim evening lighting scheme is entirely consistent with current lighting recommendations and practice, and although the light levels recommended for daytime applica-tions are relatively high compared to current practice, they are not diicult to achieve, particularly if controls are incorporated into the design. </p><p> The provided template gives a guideline for components necessary for circadian design.

The accompanied graph shows the absolute sensitivity of the human circadian system plotted as a function of light level, where the spectral power distributions (SPDs) of various light sources used in previous published studies are weighted according to circadian light (CLA), shown on the x-axis. The y-axis on the right, labeled circadian stimulus (CS), is scaled to be proportional to the y-axis on the le, which shows the amount of melatonin suppressed aer exposing the retina for 1 hour, ranging from 0.1 (no measureable suppression) to a maximum of 0.7 (70% suppression). Several previous studies employing the CS metric and involving diverse populations have shown that exposure to high levels of circadian-eective light (CS > 0.30) during the day, particularly in the morning, is associated with improved sleep quality, mood, and circadian entrainment as well as greater subjective and objective alertness. People who receive morning CS ≤ 0.10, on the other hand, are unlikely to be well synchronized to the natural day–night cycle and the various schedules that are associated with everyday life. </p><figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/lighting solution/2.png" class="float-left w-50 p-4 m-4 drop-shadow rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> Throughout a day, circadian designs target between &lt; 0.1 to 0.3 or 0.4 in a CS schedule (values above 0.4 have shown to plateau and not have any significant additional effect). When exposed for longer durations, a CS of 0.3 and above have been shown to suppress the production of melatonin (a sleep hormone that is released from the brain into the body approximately two hours before bedtime). Melatonin levels are designed to be low during the day due to the large amount of light that should be received at the eye, acting as a zeitgeber (time-giver) to tell the body it is not time to sleep. Since melatonin is an anticipatory hormone, meaning it will automatically be released about two hours prior to when the body thinks it is bedtime, the amount and type of light received during the day, as well as a person’s chronotype, determine when melatonin will be released at night. If a person is exposed in the later evening hours (past 5PM) to high light levels that correlate to a CS value above 0.3 for an extended period of time (>1 hour), the body will be tricked into thinking the day is not winding down, and melatonin release will continue to be pushed off. This can pose to be a problem especially when a person has social obligations to be on a time routine (i.e getting up for work in the morning). If a person has a hard time falling asleep and is woken up by an alarm, social jetlag can occur where a person feels tired and not in sync with social obligations or the solar day. </p><p> The brain’s circadian system cycles itself naturally every 24.2 hours, on average, so zeitgebers must be used to synchronize the body clock to the 24-hour solar day. The most influential zeitgeber is light, which when used properly can have a strong effect on the body feeling alert/awake, or tired/ready for sleep at the right times of day. Promoting a robust light/dark schedule, with achieving a CS between 0.3-0.4 in the first part of the day and reducing to below 0.1 at night will aid in the synchronization of the body to the solar day and social obligations. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Daily CS schedule - unique for occupant types</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> To achieve proper circadian entrainment, a 24-hour lighting schedule should be followed. This includes higher circadian stimulus in the early hours of the day that lowers in the evening hours. Schedules should start with either 0.3 or 0.4 targets and decrease throughout the day. Based on furniture and ultimately occupant location, a maximum target CS values of 0.3 or 0.4 should be determined. If occupant location and furniture layout is dynamic, it will be important to average a higher CS value to assure that a minimum of 0.3 is achieved where occupants may sit. However, for example, in a hospital room a patient location is known so a CS of 0.3 will need to be met at the bed. (Keep in mind, again, that patient’s orientation and therefore direction of gaze will vary in this scenario, so this should also be taken into account). All schedules should finish with a CS &lt; 0.1 during the nighttime hours to not cause circadian disruption. </p><p> Suggested CS schedules for user groups can be found on the Lighting Patterns website. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>CCT system: static or tunable</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> Sunlight is dynamic throughout the day, changing color temperature (see below) as well as brightness. Using a dynamic system that shifts white light tint can be beneficial to achieve CS values most efficaciously. Cooler white light sources, such as 6500 K, include a higher peak of the short wavelength in white light, resulting it to have a bluer tint. Applying this CCT during the hours where 0.3 or 0.4 CS are desired will require less light that needs to reach the eye. At the end of the day when CS values should not exceed 0.1, a warmer CCT, such as 3000 K could be used since the wavelengths have less of an impact on the circadian system. This way, light levels on the work plane can still be bright enough for task visibility. If a system uses multiple CCTs, it is called a color tunable system. Dimming a single CCT is termed as a static system. </p><figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/lighting solution/3.png" class="float-left w-15 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> White light is made up of a combination of wavelengths in the visible spectrum, 380 nm- 780 nm. These wavelengths associate with colors that the eye perceives using the cone photoreceptors in the retina. Essentially, the photoreceptors in the eye receive the energy from photons and with the response of the photoreceptors it will be perceived as a certain color by the brain. The color figure depicts the color creation when the primary colors of light (blue, green, and red) overlap. When similar amounts of blue, green, and red wavelengths are combined, white light is created. </p><p> A white light source can seem cooler (blue tint) or warmer (yellow tint), which is affiliated with its CCT (Correlated Color Temperature). CCT is associated with the color of light of a reference source when it is heated up to certain temperatures and is measured in degrees Kelvin (K). Typical CCT in designs can range from 2700 K (warmer white) to 6500 K (cooler white). Contrary to intuition, cooler (bluer) looking white light sources are physically hotter than warmer (yellower) looking light sources. Warmer white light is considered to be &lt; 3500 K and cooler white light is classified with sources >5000 K. The graphs below give a visual of example SPDs from LED light sources. Note that the color under the curve is given as a reference to better visualize how the associated wavelengths contribute to the varying tints of white light from an electric source. The warm-white 2700 K shows a larger area of contribution from the longer wavelengths, and less contribution from the short-wavelengths (bluer) making it appear warmer. Inversely, a cool-white 6500 K shows a greater peak in the shorter wavelengths, and a smaller area of long-wavelength contribution making it appear to have a bluer tint. SPDs for light sources all vary. SPD curves with a similar trend that appear to be the same tint will can be classified under the same CCT, but can possess different qualities that can affect outcomes such as CS and CRI. With this being the case, it is important to use the correct SPD of sources used in a design to determine its CS contribution. </p><figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/lighting solution/4.png" class="w-100 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> SPD, or spectral power distribution, graphs the amount of energy each wavelength has in a light source. Each light source is made up of a combination of wavelengths, ranging in strength, which is indicated by relative power on the y-axis. With white light being a combination of the spectral power of the many wavelengths, it is possible to have different SPDs that the brain perceives to be the same color. When the eye cannot distinguish the difference between a color that is made multiple ways, the light sources are called metamers. </p><p> All light sources have a unique SPD. for example, when typical incandescent light bulbs operate, the glow of the heated tungsten filament operates at a warmer CCT between 2600 K and 3500 K. HID lamps (high-intensity discharge) contain multiple gasses such as argon, nitrogen, xenon, and metals such as sodium and mercury. Slightly different combinations of these filaments can cause alterations to the emitted wavelengths, and concurrently its initial SPD. The filaments within fluorescents are exhausted at different rates, so over time the wavelengths the source emits change, making the lamp appear to be different colors over its lifespan. fluorescents can begin to appear to have a greener or pinker tint depending on which filaments are left to be heated. It is important to know how a lamp is going to operate throughout its lifespan and the characteristics that impact its SPD. The SPD of light sources is an important component for determining its contribution to the circadian system. With LEDs, it is possible to create any SPD curve. This can be used strategically to create light sources that impact CS levels most efficaciously. </p><figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/lighting solution/5.png" class="w-100 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> The CCT can have a large impact on how the overall atmosphere of a space feels. Even if horizontal and vertical illuminance values are the same, a space can feel brighter or dingier simply if a different CCT is used. A space can give a more concentrated, alert feel if a cooler CCT is used, compared to a warmer CCT that can make a space feel more welcoming and relaxed. Both cool and warm CCTs have their advantages that depend on the space, time of day, and user preference. Note that the brightness of light and reflectance off materials in the space also contributes to the ‘feel’ of the atmosphere. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Desired CCT</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> Based on occupant and designer preferences, and energy or horizontal illuminance concerns, a CCT can be chosen for a design. Cooler CCTs above 5000 K will provide higher CS values at lower light levels. If a dynamic CCT system is selected, multiple CCTs can be chosen. </p></div></div></div></article><article id="section-fixtures"> <div class="sticky-title text-center"> <h2>Fixtures</h2> </div><div class="container-fluid mt-4 pr-4"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Fixture types</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> fixture type is an important decision in any design. There is a balance between aesthetically pleasing light fixtures that commonly want to provide adequate lighting for task visibility (horizontal illuminance). Another fundamental component to design for is light that stimulates the circadian system (vertical illuminance). Creating layers of light in a space would provide the most benefit for all desired components. fixtures of higher lumen output with distributions that provide the most light to the eye should be placed in locations near occupants. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Beam distribution</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/fixtures/1.png" class="float-right w-25 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> <p> The distribution and intensity of light coming out of a fixture will determine how much light gets to the eye. A candela plot shows different cuts of a light fixture to understand how it will distribute light. Typically, a vertical cut (shown in blue) indicates the shape and intensity of light that will be distributed down into a space. The horizontal cut (shown in red) indicates the shape and intensity of light if you were looking at a light source from above. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Orientation of fixture: direct vs indirect</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> Direct versus indirect lighting simply indicates which direction light fixture project light. Typical fixtures are placed in the ceiling and send light downward into the space providing ‘direct’ light, such as a troffer, downlight, and recessed linear. To reduce glare from direct view of the source, lighting fixtures can be hidden in the architecture or fixture housing. If fixtures are oriented upwards, it is considered ‘indirect’ lighting. Coves and wall valances can hide upward facing fixtures and light will bounce off the ceiling or walls to more gently fill the space with light. Some fixtures can provide both direct (task) illumination as well as indirect (ambient) lighting. An example would be a direct/indirect linear pendant or wall mounted valance. </p><figure><img src="img/background/circadian design/fixtures/2.png" class="w-100 p-1 m-4 rounded" alt=""/></figure> </div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Mounting height</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> Typical overhead lighting is mount on, recessed into, or hanging from the ceiling.

If a number of fixtures with their beam distribution are placed in locations to provide adequate light levels to the eye, less lumen output will be needed. If cooler CCTs are chosen, less light is needed at the eye to reach CS levels, therefore initial lumen output will be less for a design starting with a cooler CCT vs warmer CCT. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Initial wattage</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> The wattage necessary to drive a light source relates to the lumen output.

Some of these light loss factors include lumen or dirt depreciation. These factors will vary per fixture, but should be taken into account so that towards the end of lamp life, light levels to reach CS are still being achieved. </p></div></div></div></article><article id="section-computerDesign"> <div class="sticky-title text-center"> <h2>Computer Design</h2> </div><div class="container-fluid mt-4 pr-4"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Lighting design software</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> Doing light calculations before installation is beneficial to determine the most ideal fixtures and layout to implement into a design. Many iterations and fixtures can be quickly tested to predict how light will interact in a space. Modeling your space to include furniture location and material reflectance will give a good estimate as to light levels that will be achieved at specified locations. An available software for modeling a space and calculating light is AGi.

The Daysimeter is a one-of-a-kind practical device, as it measures circadian light based on a model of human circadian phototransduction proposed by the LRC, and is calibrated in terms of both photopic lux and circadian illuminance (a term based on the spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system.) Through use of the Daysimeter and associated software, LRC researchers are able to interpret light as a stimulus to the circadian system, quantify circadian disruption and circadian stimulus, and prescribe light treatments for adjusting circadian phase. Named one of the Top Ten Innovations of 2011, the Daysimeter and its smaller counterpart, the Daysimeter-D, are valuable tools in furthering our understanding of light&#39;s impact on human health. </p></div></div><div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>CS calculator</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> Again, the CS calculator can be used to determine CS values of the applied or existing design. </p></div></div></div></article><article id="section-results"> <div class="sticky-title text-center"> <h2>Results</h2> </div><div class="container-fluid mt-4 pr-4"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-3 cornell-border"> <h6>Average vertical illuminance</h6> </div><div class="col-md-9"> <p> How do your achieved vertical illuminances compare to your target vertical illuminances on the CS schedule chart?
