Light reaching the back of our eyes is the main stimulus that helps the circadian clock, and thus circadian rhythms, to synchronize with the 24-hour day. Circadian rhythms are every rhythm in our body that repeat at approximately every 24 hours, such as the sleep-wake cycle. In the absence of this daily light-dark pattern, the circadian system will run with a period slightly greater than 24 hours (on average, 24.2 hours) and, therefore, will be desynchronized with the local time on earth. Light of the appropriate quantity, spectrum, duration, and timing can have profound effect on sleep, alertness, performance, and mood. Irregular light-dark patterns or exposure to light at the wrong circadian time may lead to circadian disruption. Short-term circadian disruption leads to poor sleep and poor performance. Circadian disruption over many years, such as that experienced by night shift workers, has been associated with health risks, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. </p><p class="text-justify">This site aims to connect the dots between research in lighting, the education of lighting research, and the application of the lighting into real-life scenarios by providing design suggestions for specific facility types and groups of people within them. Educating designers, manufacturers, and the general public would lead to better application of circadian lighting within the needs of specific user groups. To learn more about lighting and what it can do, click on the questions in the tabs to the left. Within the text, click on underlined terms to bring up quick definitions.</p><p class="text-justify">To learn more about specific applications, click the ‘Application’ button in the upper right. Navigation between facility, room, and fixture types show examples of how the varying components of lighting (fixture type, distribution, lumen output, tint of white light, intensity, etc.) impact design. Room renders, fixture layout and descriptions, and circadian charts give an idea of how circadian <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" title="Popover title" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" data-content="And heres some amazing content.

    $('#content').html('<h1>Healthy Buildings Application</h1><p class="text-justify">The banner at the top allows you to choose a facility- Office, Healthcare, School, or Senior Care. Once a facility is chosen, designs for specific rooms are available to choose from. Choose between fixture types, target CS as well as the lighting system (static or tunable CCT), CCT, and time of day. Descriptions on each will pop up to give more information on the selections. The example CS chart will change depending on the selected target CS as well as CCT. The chart gives information on a proposed CS schedule throughout a day. To change CS levels throughout the day, lighting systems must be dimmed and/or a color tunable system (e.g. 5000 K [morning] -> 4000 K [afternoon] -> 3000 K [evening]). Target vertical and horizontal illuminance levels are given on the chart. Vertical illuminance (illuminance at the eye) provides the light levels needed to reach the desired CS value, and the associated horizontal illuminance is calculated using the vertical to horizontal ratio of the fixtures in the design. The target vertical illuminance values vary based on CCT, and can be observed by going through the different CCTs and discovering how required vertical light levels vary depending on the chosen CCT. (Note that illuminance values to meet CS levels are based on a typical SPD for the varying CCTs indicated in the design. Designs that use SPDs that differ from this will need to perform their own CS calculations based on the fixture’s SPD). Since some CCTs require less light at the eye to achieve a CS of 0.3-0.4, initial lumen output and necessary fixture wattage fluctuates.</p><p class="text-justify">If a CS schedule is followed throughout a day, you may use the chart to figure out what light levels to target based on a CCT. Examples of a tunable CCT system are given as well. Using certain CCTs will allow a design to use fixtures that have a lower initial lumen output as well as a lower wattage, while maintaining a desired CS value. If possible, using a tunable system would provide the most benefit; using a cooler CCT in the morning to achieve a CS value of 0.4 or 0.3 requiring less light output, then dimming/warming in the evening to create a robust light/dark pattern. Note that designers aren’t limited to the example tunable schedules given. For example, if warmer CCTs are desired, 4000 K can be used for multiple time slots and can color tune to 3000 K at the end of the day. Using illuminance values for reference from both the 4000 K and 3000 K chart will be needed.</p><p class="text-justify">Lighting plans are designs with a general fixture placement layout. Calculations are based on typical spacing to determine average light levels of evenly spaced fixtures that provide proper circadian levels. Applying desired combinations of these fixtures within a room that better suit design goals is recommended. Additional lighting for aesthetic or accenting can be used by designer discretion as well.</p><p class="text-justify">These designs are guideline patterns for how certain fixture types act as a system in certain space layouts. The assumptions made for the pattern designs are given; fixture type, beam distribution, lumen output, wattage, and SPD. Individualized calculations must be done for each project due to changing parameters such as room height, material reflectance, square footage, and fixture properties.</p><p class="text-justify">Click on ‘?’ to learn more about each option and tips on what to choose.</p>');
