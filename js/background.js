    $('#content').html('<h1>Introduction</h1><p class="text-justify">All creatures, great and small, are governed by the earth’s 24-hour cycle of light and dark, day and night. Light reaching the back of our eyes is the main stimulus that helps the circadian clock, and thus circadian rhythms, to synchronize with the 24-hour day. Circadian rhythms are every rhythm in our body that repeat at approximately every 24 hours, such as the sleep-wake cycle. In the absence of this daily light-dark pattern, the circadian system will run with a period slightly greater than 24 hours (on average, 24.2 hours) and, therefore, will be desynchronized with the local time on earth. Light of the appropriate quantity, spectrum, duration, and timing can have profound effect on sleep, alertness, performance, and mood. Irregular light-dark patterns or exposure to light at the wrong circadian time may lead to circadian disruption. Short-term circadian disruption leads to poor sleep and poor performance. Circadian disruption over many years, such as that experienced by night shift workers, has been associated with health risks, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. </p><figure class="float-left"><img src="img/information/1/1.png" width="450px" alt="Research - Education - Application Diagram" /></figure><p class="text-justify">This site aims to connect the dots between research in lighting, the education of lighting research, and the application of the lighting into real-life scenarios by providing design suggestions for specific facility types and groups of people within them.

    $('#content').html('<h1>Healthy Buildings Application</h1><p class="text-justify">The banner at the top allows you to choose a facility- Office, Healthcare, School, or Senior Care. Once a facility is chosen, designs for specific rooms are available to choose from. Choose between fixture types, target CS as well as the lighting system (static or tunable CCT), CCT, and time of day. Descriptions on each will pop up to give more information on the selections. The example CS chart will change depending on the selected target CS as well as CCT. The chart gives information on a proposed CS schedule throughout a day. To change CS levels throughout the day, lighting systems must be dimmed and/or a color tunable system (e.g. 5000 K [morning] -> 4000 K [afternoon] -> 3000 K [evening]). Target vertical and horizontal illuminance levels are given on the chart. Vertical illuminance (illuminance at the eye) provides the light levels needed to reach the desired CS value, and the associated horizontal illuminance is calculated using the vertical to horizontal ratio of the fixtures in the design. The target vertical illuminance values vary based on CCT, and can be observed by going through the different CCTs and discovering how required vertical light levels vary depending on the chosen CCT. (Note that illuminance values to meet CS levels are based on a typical SPD for the varying CCTs indicated in the design. Designs that use SPDs that differ from this will need to perform their own CS calculations based on the fixture’s SPD). Since some CCTs require less light at the eye to achieve a CS of 0.3-0.4, initial lumen output and necessary fixture wattage fluctuates.</p><p class="text-justify">If a CS schedule is followed throughout a day, you may use the chart to figure out what light levels to target based on a CCT. Examples of a tunable CCT system are given as well. Using certain CCTs will allow a design to use fixtures that have a lower initial lumen output as well as a lower wattage, while maintaining a desired CS value. If possible, using a tunable system would provide the most benefit; using a cooler CCT in the morning to achieve a CS value of 0.4 or 0.3 requiring less light output, then dimming/warming in the evening to create a robust light/dark pattern. Note that designers aren’t limited to the example tunable schedules given. For example, if warmer CCTs are desired, 4000 K can be used for multiple time slots and can color tune to 3000 K at the end of the day. Using illuminance values for reference from both the 4000 K and 3000 K chart will be needed.</p><p class="text-justify">Lighting plans are designs with a general fixture placement layout. Calculations are based on typical spacing to determine average light levels of evenly spaced fixtures that provide proper circadian levels. Applying desired combinations of these fixtures within a room that better suit design goals is recommended. Additional lighting for aesthetic or accenting can be used by designer discretion as well.</p><p class="text-justify">These designs are guideline patterns for how certain fixture types act as a system in certain space layouts. The assumptions made for the pattern designs are given; fixture type, beam distribution, lumen output, wattage, and SPD.

    $('#content').html('<h1>Structure of the Eye</h1><p class="text-justify">The eye is a complex structure that is a visual relay system who takes messages from light energy, interprets it, and sends it to the brain for perceiving. Light first enters through the cornea, and 2/3 of the bending of light happens at this air-to-cornea threshold. The eye is sensitive to the brightness of light, and the pupil changes in size to accommodate for the dynamic changes in light level throughout the day The pupil will become a larger aperture in darker environments to let in more light in order to see better. Oppositely, in bright environments, such as a sunny day, the pupil decreases in size to reduce the discomfort from bright and glary sources. This expansion and contraction is controlled by the ciliary muscle. When light enters through the lens, since the lens is a convex shape, it will bend the light and direct it to the macula where it is focused.<sup><a href="https://www.vmrinstitute.com/what-is-the-macula/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> The fovea is a responsible for central vision, where we can detect fine detail and colors. It makes up 2 degrees of the whole retina, yet we rely on it heavily for discrimination of detail. The retina contains photoreceptors that are sensitive to wavelengths in the visible spectrum (approximately 380-780 nm). The way light within this spectrum interacts and bounces off surfaces and into the eye is what allows us to see things. The tissues in retina are an extension of the brain, so it plays an important role in relaying information from the environment to the brain to perceive. Information that the photoreceptors in the retina perceive send signals through the optic nerve and into the brain. Since there is a break in the retina where the optic nerve is located, the optic disc creates a blind spot. </p><figure><img src="img/information/7/1.png" width="700px" alt="Diagram of Eyeball" /></figure><hr/><br/><p class="float-left"> &nbsp; <sup>1 </sup><a href="https://www.vmrinstitute.com/what-is-the-macula/">https://www.vmrinstitute.com/what-is-the-macula/</a></p>');

    $('#content').html('<h1>Color Vision</h1><p class="text-justify">The visible spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum contains wavelengths that a human’s eyeball is able to perceive. In other words, they speak the same language, and the mechanisms in the eye translate these signals for the brain to interpret. As the name suggests, waves in the visible spectrum have varying lengths, as seen in the figure below.</p><p class="text-justify">For colors to be visible, a mechanism that can interpret the wavelengths must be in place. That is where the photoreceptors in the eye come into play. The eye is made up of photoreceptors in the fovea (central vision) and the rest of the retina (peripheral vision). The human eye has an inverted retina, meaning light goes past all the layers to the photoreceptor layer which is located in the back of the retina. Here, it gets absorbed and sent back through the layers and exits through the optic nerve. Within the layers of the retina, the absorbed light gets sent through layers that interpret the signal and transmit the message for the brain to perceive. Color is perceived by the cone photoreceptors. The eye contains three cones: long-, medium-, and short-wavelength cones. Each have peak wavelength sensitivity,. Long-wavelength cones have a peak sensitivity at 564 nm, medium-wavelength cones at 533 nm, and short-wavelength cones at 437 nm. As seen in the figure below, each photoreceptor has a range of wavelengths that they are sensitive to and will activate a response. The y-axis on the graph associates with how much absorption of light each photoreceptor is capable of at each wavelength.</p><p class="text-justify">Knowing these wavelengths associate to perceived color in the visible spectrum, the combination of signals all the cones receive go through the Bipolar “connector” cell layer that takes combined signals from different photoreceptors throughout the retina. The Ganglion layer then communicates with multiple bipolar layers to determine what electrical signal it wants to send to the brain. An oversimplification, but the takeaway is that the messages sent to the brain go through multiple layers in communication with one another, getting feedback and deciding on what message it will send to the brain. The brain then interprets this signal to determine what color and image it sees. The figure below depicts the connections of the components in the retina and the process light undergoes when traveling through the retina.</p><figure><img src="img/information/8/1.png" width="700px" alt="Structure of Retina" /></figure>');

This is because only your rods can detect such low light levels. If you try to look directly at it, it will seem to disappear because your central vision is only made up of cones that need higher light levels to be activated. This also explains that when your vision adapts to the dark when you’re outside at night, you can’t see color because cones don’t activate at such low light levels. The figure below shows a graph of the amount and distribution of rods and cones in the retina, with the center of the fovea being 0 degrees.</p><figure><img src="img/information/9/2.png" width="500px" alt="Rods and Cones Density" /></figure><hr/><br/><p class="float-left"> &nbsp; <sup>2 </sup>Human Factors in Lighting- Peter Boyce: Page 52</p>');

Each light source is made up of a combination of wavelengths, ranging in strength, which is indicated by relative power on the y-axis.

These wavelengths associate with colors that the eye perceives (using the cone photoreceptors in the retina). Essentially, the photoreceptors in the eye receive the energy from photons and with the response of the photoreceptors it will be perceived as a certain color. The color figure below depicts the color creation when the primary colors of light (blue, green, and red) overlap. When similar amounts of blue, green, and red wavelengths are combined, white light is created.</p><figure><img src="img/information/12/1.png" class="keep-small" width="300px" alt="White Light" /></figure><p class="text-justify">A white light source can seem cooler (blue tint) or warmer (yellow tint), which is affiliated with its CCT (Correlated Color Temperature). CCT is associated with the color of light of a reference source when it is heated up to certain temperatures and is measured in degrees Kelvin (K). Typical CCT in designs can range from 2700 K (warmer white) to 6500 K (cooler white). The graphs below give a visual of example SPDs from LEDs. Note that the color under the curve is given as a reference to better visualize how the associated wavelengths contribute to the varying tints of white light from an electric source. The warm-white 2700 K shows a larger area of contribution from the longer wavelengths, and less contribution from the short-wavelengths (bluer) making it appear warmer. Inversely, a cool-white 6500 K shows a greater peak in the shorter wavelengths, and a smaller area of long-wavelength contribution making it appear cooler. SPDs for light sources all vary. SPD curves with a similar trend that appear to be the same tint will can be classified under the same CCT, but can possess different qualities that can affect outcomes such as CS and CRI. With this being the case, it is important to use the correct SPD of sources used in a design to determine its CS contribution (See CS tab).</p><figure><img src="img/information/12/2.png" class="wide" width="800px" alt="CCT SPDs" /></figure><p class="text-justify">The CCT can have a large impact on how the overall atmosphere of a space feels. Even if horizontal and vertical illuminance values are the same, a space can feel brighter or dingier simply if a different CCT is used. A space can give a more concentrated, alert feel if a cooler CCT is used, compared to a warmer CCT that can make a space feel more welcoming and relaxed. Both cool and warm CCTs have their advantages that depend of the space, time of day, and user preference.</p><figure><img src="img/information/12/3.png" class="wide" width="800px" alt="CCT Gradient" /></figure>');

    $('#content').html('<h1>Colorblindness</h1><p class="text-justify">Contrary to the typical association with ‘blindness,’ color blindness does not eradicate vision, it merely inhibits the ability to discriminate colors. Since humans typically have three cone (color) photoreceptors, there are three types of colorblindness. Tritan-type color vision is characterized from S-cones not detecting bluer wavelengths correctly, duetan-type color vision from the M-cone not detecting/discriminating greens, and protan-type color vision from the L-cone not detecting/discriminating reds. Since the cones are not absent, just lacking a range of discrimination different from the other photoreceptors, it is difficult to tell hues apart. This is similar to how colors appear less saturated in dim light conditions. With low light levels, you will be able to see the object, but its color appearance seems dull and similar to other objects around it.</p><p class="text-justify">Humans are one of the few species that have three photoreceptors. The amount of photoreceptor types in the retina is determined by how a species has evolved to need vision for survival. Nocturnal animals, for example, are more concerned with night vision and the contrast and discrimination of objects or animals in the dark, so color vision is of less importance. On the other hand, certain insects such as bees contain a forth photoreceptor that allows them to visually interpret ultraviolet wavelengths which are present in the leaves of flowers they need to pollinate.</p>');

An LED of a saturated color can be considered a narrowband source if the SPD has a small range in associated wavelengths.

    $('#content').html('<h1>CS</h1><p class="text-justify">CS stands for circadian stimulus. This metric is based on the found response of the circadian system to light exposure (intensity and duration). The metric for CS is based on a scale of 0.0 to 0.7. Circadian designs target between 0.1-0.4 in a CS schedule (values above 0.4 have shown to plateau and not have any significant additional effect). A CS of 0.3 and above have been shown to suppress the production of melatonin (a sleep hormone that is released from the brain two hours before bedtime). Melatonin levels are designed to be low during the day due to the large amount of light that should be received at the eye, acting as a zeitgeber (or time-giver) to tell the body it is not time for bed. Since melatonin is an anticipatory hormone, meaning it will automatically be released about two hours prior to when the body thinks it is bedtime, the amount and type of light received during the day (as well as a person’s chronotype) determine when melatonin will be released at night. If a person is exposed in the later evening hours (past 5PM) to high light levels that correlate to a CS value above 0.3 for an extended period of time (>1 hour), the body will be tricked into thinking the day is not winding down, and melatonin release will continue to be pushed off. This can pose to be a problem especially when a person has social obligations to be on a time routine (i.e getting up for work in the morning). If a person has a hard time falling asleep and is woken up by an alarm, social jetlag can occur where a person feels tired and not in sync with social obligations or the solar day. The brain’s circadian system cycles itself every 24.2 hours naturally, so zeitgebers must be used to synchronize the body clock to the 24-hour solar day. The most influential zeitgeber is light, which when used properly can have a strong effect on the body feeling alert/awake, or tired/ready for sleep at the right times of day. Promoting a robust light/dark schedule, with achieving a CS between 0.3-0.4 in the first part of the day and reducing to below 0.1 at night will aid in the synchronization of the body to the solar day and social obligations.</p><figure><img src="img/information/18/1.png" width="500px" alt="CS scale" /></figure>');
