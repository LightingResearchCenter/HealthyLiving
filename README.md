  The <em>Healthy Living</em> site is made up of two parts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The <i>Background</i> page consists of information we, at the LRC, consider vital in understanding how light affects health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The <i>Application</i> page is essentially a library of examples of effective lighting in different spaces.
