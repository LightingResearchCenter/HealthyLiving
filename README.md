  The <em>Healthy Living</em> site is made up of two parts. The <i>Background</i> page consists of information we, at the LRC, consider vital in understanding how light affects health. The <i>Application</i> page is essentially a library of examples of effective lighting in different spaces.

## Getting started
The Healthy Living website is hosted at https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/secret/healthyliving

## Background
The background page is a great way for users of all levels of light knowledge to learn something new.
<br/>

Below is a list of the specific topics we cover on the background page. These concepts do not make up a perfect list of everything light, instead, they are the concepts we believe to most important in understanding how the healthy living application works and also in understand the work the <a href="https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/lightHealth/alliance.asp">light and health alliance</a> does.
