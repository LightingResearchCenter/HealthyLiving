                      Clicking one of these fixture buttons will open up a dropdown in the right panel menu corresponding to that fixture. This menu will you give you more information about that fixture type, including a larger fixture <b>image</b>, a <b>candela plot</b>, along with many important <b>measurements</b> and a <b>description</b>. To learn more about the fixtures menu in the right panel, or the right panel in general, click <a id="help-rightpanel-jump" href="#">here</a> or select the <b>Right Panel</b> tab.

Circadian lighting schedules differ depending on user types, so navigate through the facility and room options to explore these variations. Lighting designs are given for multiple fixture types as well as CCT values. Providing multiple solutions allows for the decision to be yours to choose which parameters fit your design best. For more information about lighting and circadian rhythms, refer to the background page.</p>
